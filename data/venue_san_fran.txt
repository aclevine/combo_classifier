Hubby and I are arriving in <v>San fran</v> on Saturday eve, staying for 4 nights at the <v>Travelodge Golden Gate</v>. 

Breakfast: <v>Mel's</v>, <v>First Watch</v> on Lombard. <v>Judy's</v>, The <v>Grove</v>, <v>Becelli's</v>, <v>Blue Barn</v>, <v>Squat</v> and <v>Gobble</v> on Chestnut.

Try <v>betelnut</v> for relatively spicy Asian food on Union street. While not purely sea food. We love <v>Allegria</v> on Lombard for Tapas

Thanks guys - those recommendations look great. I've also seen <v>Marmacita</v> on here which looks perfect and <v>Sotto Mare</v>. 

Something tells me <v>Sotto Mare</v> doesn't "do" email. Give them a call when you arrive.

Burgers? Perhaps <v>Burger Bar</v> inside <v>Macy's</v>. My faves are in the neighborhoods not downtown but I'd bet <v>Original Joe's</v> on Washington Square does a good one.

"Best" pizza everyone yelps about <v>Tony's</v> on Stockton Street but getting in is tough. But I don't fawn over pizza the way a lot of people do. <v>Uncle Vito's</v> on Powell may suffice.

TBH, Italian? There are hundreds within walking distance of your hotel. <v>Fino's</v> near Union Square, <v>Sotto Mare</v>, <v>Ideale</v>, <v>Contadina</v>, <v>Joe's</v>, <v>Capps</v>, etc.

Thai - hole in the wall ok? King of Thai Noodles on <v>O'Farrell</v>. Great spicy beef noodles. Does basic dishes well too. Open late.

<v>Tony's</v> and <v>Uncle Vito's</v> are two of our favorites for pizza; also <v>L'Osteria del Forno</v> in North Beach. <v>Frascati</v> on the Powell-Hyde cable car line is wonderful for its classic northern Italian menu.

<v>Burger Bar</v> is very good for somewhat upscale burgers; or <v>In-N-Out</v> at Fisherman's Wharf area (easily accessible by cable car) is at the top of the heap for fast-food.

have you tried Burmese food? Similar flavor palette as Thai. You have to travel to The Richmond though. <v>Burma Superstar</v>, <v>B Star</v>, or <v>Mandalay</v>.

So do folks think it's easier to get a seat at <v>Tony's</v> or either of the <v>Delfina</v> location?

Not sure if it's the best but certainly cheap, close enough to walk, and nostalgic for me. <v>Blondie's</v> at the Powell cable car turnaround. 

My favorite ice cream place is <v>Xanath</v> in the <v>Mission</v>.

No love for <v>Mitchell's</v> ice cream in the <v>Mission</v>? Their Mexican chocolate is about the perfect combination of chocolate and cinnamon to me.

I'm a cheap date. Rather than wait for a seat at <v>Tony's</v>, I go next door and grab a slice from their takeout place, then eat it outside 

I am fond of <v>Mitchell's</v> ice cream on San Jose Avenue. 

It is a bit of a ride from the <v>Fairmont</v> though

Pizza - <v>Delfina's</v> or <v>Tony's</v> and takeout is fine as was mentioned

Burger -- Best sit down would be <v>Burger bar</v> but cheaper burger at <v>Pearl's burgers</v>.

ice cream spot -- well something unique is <v>Smitten</v> in <v>Hayes Valley</v> - ice cream made to order

Thai -- <v>Lers Ros</v> in the <v>Tenderloin</v> or in <v>Hayes Valley</v> -- eat something spicy (pork belly) and go for <v>Smitten</v> after that

Breakfast - <v>Mamma's</v> or <v>Dottie's</v> but Pinecrest would be closer and won't have long lines

Lots of love for <v>Mitchell's</v> from me. I too love their tropical fruit. 

Breakfast at <v>Mama's</v> - have never been. again due to the lines every time I pass by.

Four of us went to <v>Tony's</v> for lunch on a Saturday.

dinner near <v>SFO airport</v>?

For meat.... we have had good meals at: <v>Cleo's</v> - fun Brazilian place, cheaper than the more popular <v>Espetus</v> (http://www.cleossteakhouse.com/about-us/), <v>Broadway Prime</v> (http://www.broadwayprime.com/)

A bit over your budget but the best restaurant in the area is <v>Stella Alpina Osteria</v>: http://www.stellaalpinaosteria.com/

if you don't mind a chain try the <v>Elephant Bar</v> in <v>Burlingame</v>, all of the other places mentioned are at the top or above your budget.

I like <v>Cleo's</v> but it 29.99 p/p, but all the meat you can eat.

Planning a visit to <v>Alcatraz</v>?

We already have tickets for an <v>Alcatraz</v> tour.

heading into <v>San Francisco</v> August 7-9.

If you're simply looking for the standard list of "Top 10s", regardless of your own interests, then: <v>Golden Gate Bridge</v>, <v>Fisherman's Wharf</v>, <v>Chinatown</v>, cable cars, <v>Lombard Street</v>, <v>Golden Gate Park</v>, <v>Alcatraz</v>, <v>Union Square</v>, <v>North Beach</v>.

But if you're an art lover, it would be a shame to miss one of our museums, such as the <v>de Young</v> in <v>Golden Gate Park</v>. 

If you love Japanese manga and pop culture, you'd be missing out on <v>Japan Center</v>. 

If you're a war buff, you'd be skipping the Civil-War-era <v>Fort Point</v> or the WWII submarine <v>Pampanito</v>. 

If you love old boats, you wouldn't know about the <v>Maritime Museum</v> at the <v>Hyde Street Pier</v>.

Thinking about going to either <v>Waterbar</v>, <v>Farallon</v> or <v>Le Mer</v>.

<v>Akiko's Restaurant</v> strictly by reservation only.

<v>Saru Sushi</v> at 9?

<v>Pacific Catch</v> is a Bay Area chain with Asian Influences

Just stay away from anywhere on <v>Fisherman's Wharf</v> for reasonable prices, except <v>Cod Mothers Fish & Chips</v>. <v>Scoma's</v> is good, but not for there prices.

We went to <v>Sotto Mare</v> in <v>North Beach</v> last week and it was to-die-for!

Have been browsing the internet for another hotel & found the <v>Chancellor Hotel</v> on Union Square 

The <v>Chancellor</v> is a highly recommended hotel in these parts, definitely.

I have just booked the <v>Chancellor</v> & will cancel the <v>Hotel California</v>.

We are frequent guests at the <v>Chancellor</v>. You will like it.

Everything about the <v>Chancellor</v> is better than the <v>Hotel California</v> -- not just the location. 

You can't go wrong with the <v>Chancellor</v>.

You made a most excellent move. The <v>Chancellor</v> is a world better than the <v>Hotel California</v>. 

Hi. I am looking to a book an <v>Alcatraz</v> night tour for just myself on either Sunday 7th or Monday the 8th of September 

Planning on going for a late dinner after we take the evening tour of <v>Alcatraz</v>

<v>E' Tutto Qua</v> is one that stays open late. <v>Ideale</v> is another.

Other things we would like to do that day: eat at <v>Molinari Delicatessen</v>, stop into <v>City Lights</v>, ride a cable car, walk Telegraph Hill, explore <v>North Beach</v> & <v>Chinatown</v>, see the <v>Painted Ladies</v>. 

we booked the <v>Coventry Motor Inn</v>.

Although they are near the <v>Union Square</v> area you might consider the a <v>White Swan</v> or <v>Petite Auberge</v>.

Should we book the <v>Alcatraz</v> night tour for day 2? 

We don't have any set plans, but we'd like to see <v>Alcatraz</v>. 

If you don't mind a shared bath, look at the <v>San Remo</v>. Or there's a hostel at <v>Fort Mason</v>. 

Did you look at the <v>Columbus Motor Inn</v>?

The <v>Columbus Motor Inn</v> has several sister hotels on Lombard that are also within walking distance

Hi! We're going to be in <v>San Francisco</v> for two days in late August. Our current itinerary looks like this:
Day 1: <v>Angel Island</v> (Museum, hiking, etc)
Day 2: <v>California Academy of Sciences</v>, <v>Japanese Tea Garden</v>, Seeing <v>Golden Gate Bridge</v>

Definitely walk through <v>Chinatown</v>

<v>California Academy of Sciences</v> (10:00am to 2:00pm probably?)

OR have dinner at <v>Joe's Taco Lounge</v> in <v>Mill Valley</v> and then go have cocktails and hear some music at <v>Sweetwater Music Hall</v> ....

you could do dinner somewhere along the <v>Embarcardero</v>- there are a few places to choose from depending on what food you like-- <v>Coqueta</v>, <v>La Mar Cebicheria</v>, <v>Waterbar</v>, <v>Epic Roasthouse</v>, <v>Slanted Door</v>, are a few.

<v>Hard Water</v> is a place to stop for a drink, <v>La Mar</v> has a bar too.

For desserts <v>B patisserie</v>, <v>Craftsman and wolves</v>, <v>Dianda's</v>. Oh, and <v>La Tartine</v> in the <v>mission</v>, <v>Tout Suite</v> and many many more places have great desserts .

Day 2 (Sunday) – Catch bus to <v>Pier 33</v> for <v>Alcatraz</v> tour departing at 10.30 (tickets booked). 

Day 3 (Monday) Drive across the <v>Golden Gate Bridge</v>, spend the day exploring the <v>Marin Headlands</v> area, <v>Sausalito</v> and possibly more

Day 4 (Tuesday) Half day only as flying home and need to be at the airport by 3.45 pm Drive up to <v>Golden Gate Park</v>. 

We are staying at the <v>Marina Motel</v> on Lombard St

You and your mom will love <v>San Francisco</v>.

Try <v>Honey Honey</v> on Post. Or perhaps the <v>Pinecrest Diner</v> on Geary.

Three and a half blocks away in the <v>Chancellor Hotel</v>, <v>Luque's</v> will give you anything you want. 

3rd day: <v>SF City Hall</v>, <V>St. Mary`s Cathedral</v>, <v>Grace Cathedral</v>, Lunch, <v>Chinatown</v>

1st: Perhaps include the <v>Japanese Tea Garden</v> and <v>Stow Lake</v>? 

Don't miss:

The <v>elephant seals</v> 4 miles north of <v>Piedras Blancas</v>
-<v>Ragged Point</v> (Grab a bite to eat here or something at <v>Hearst Castle's</v> snack bar)
-<v>McWay Falls</v>
-<v>Bixby Bridge</v>
-<v>Point Lobos</v>

For Ramen I like <v>Suzu</v> in <v>Japantown</v>.

For <v>Golden Gate Bridge</v> viewing I have two favorites.... one is above <v>Ft Mason</v>. Go up the hill from <v>Ghiradelli</v>, and then east on Bay.

Have not been to <v>Suzu</v> for a long time. We go eat Sushi in the <v>Japan town</v> . Must go back to <v>Suzu</v>

I was just at <v>Cow Hollow Inn</v> last week and it worked out great. 

Because I am in the <v>Financial District</v> on most of my trips, <v>Ramen Underground</v> is my most common spot, but <v>Izakaya Roku</v> has a Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen that I have dreams about.

I also like <v>Ken Ken</v> and <v>Tenpopo</v>, but maybe maybe it is just because I love restaurants with letters that repeat.

It will be packed but one of our fav sushi places called <v>INO sushi</v> is inside the huge Japantown building

<v>Japantown/v> - meh. See what's going on at <v>Yoshi's</v>, on Fillmore St.

I'm there often enough that I see more people dining on kushiyaki, shabu shabu, or noodles. I recommend <v>Suzu Noodle House<v>, but you should be there as early as possible with your name added to the clipboard

Further up the street on Fillmore is <v>Aqua Forest Aquarium</v>. They specialize in the Nature style.

And for eats, <v>Dosa on Fillmore</v>. But you definitely need reservations if you are going during this time.

The <v>Inner Richmond</v> neighborhood has great Asian dining spots. I go with friends to <v>China First</v> restaurant on Clement between 4th and 5th Avenue. 

I have limited dining experience in <v>Chinatown</v>, but had a very nice dinner at <v>Great Eastern Restaurant</v>. Right next door was <v>Z and Y</v> which we will try next time.

<v>R&G Lounge</v> is our go to place in <v>Chinatown</v>.

<v>Great Eastern</v> is known for their seafood (as is <v>R&G Lounge</v>)

<v>Hunan Homes</v> is right across the street from <v>Great Eastern</v> and has the more smoky, spicy Hunan style (not specifically seafood).  

<v>Bund Shanghai</v> is on the same 600 block of Jackson Street and is <v>Shanghai style</v>. <v>Z&Y</v> is also on the block and is the very spicy Schezuan style.

Artisanal Toast!! <v>Reveille Coffee</v> on 200 Columbus is at the border between <v>Chinatown</v> and <v>North Beach</v>.
 
My suggestions: <v>Pinecrest Diner</v> on Geary, <v>Lucque's</v> in the <v>Chancellor Hotel</v>, <v>Dottie's</v> on 6th St (but go early or stand in line), <v>Mama's</v> on Washington Square in <v>North Beach</v> (ditto)

Not Recommended: <v>Lorie's Diner</v>

The <v>Golden Coffee Shop</v> on Sutter?

Sorry, I love you guys, but come on. <v>Pinecrest Diner</v>? A coffee shop? Standing in line for somewhat over-hyped food? This is their honeymoon!

Would agree with the above. The <v>Palace</v> would be great. 

Another vote for <v>Luque's</v> in the <v>Chancellor Hotel</v>.

+ 1 for <v>Chuckle</v>.

Personally, I think that <v>Season's</v> Restaurant (<v>Four Seasons Hotel</v> on Market St) has one of the best breakfasts in that area of the city.

For something out of the ordinary, I also like the <v>Campton Place</v>, on Stockton between Sutter and Post. The chef has some great Indian/Indian-inspired offerings 

If your boys like pizza -- can't imagine they don't -- they'll enjoy <v>Tony's Pizza Napoletana</v> in <v>North Beach</v> and <v>Uncle Vito's</v> at the corner of Bush and Powell.

Not a whole lot to recommend in the <v>Fisherman's Wharf</v> area, but the best option would be <v>Scoma's</v> for seafood. 

Nothing is cheap on <v>Fisherman's Wharf</v>, and not much is good. <v>In & Out</v> is about the only place I'd recommend, and <v>Scoma's</v> recommended above is expensive

<v>Cod mother's</v> fish and chips in <v>Fisherman's wharf</v> and <v>kara's cupcakes</v> and <v>Ghiradelli Ice cream</v> (more of a national chain now)

<v>Macy's</v> on Union Square has a cheap asian place called <v>Asian box</v> which is yummy and very cheap (see hours)

The <v>Westfield shopping center</v> is close by to the <v>Union Square</v> area and has a food court that is good and restaurants like <v>Cupola pizzeria</v> which is excellent on the top floor.

You can load up your gang for cheap at <v>Lefty O'Doul's</v> near <v>Union Square</v>. 

Also in the <v>Fisherman's Wharf</v> are is <v>Blue Mermaid Chowder House</v> at the <v>Argonaut Hotel</v>. Good food and right next to the <v>Maritime Museum</v> of SF.

Day Trip to <v>Half Moon Bay</v> or <v>Sonoma</v>? Need advice on deciding

and devote a day to <v>Golden Gate Park</v> and perhaps then have dinner at the <v>Cliff House</v> by the ocean.

2) Another night go to <v>Chinatown</v> and have dinner out there.

<v>Tuscan inn</v> is good

The <v>2620</v> is a recent addition so that would be ok if you want a deal.

Which hotel? trying to decide between <v>Tuscan Inn</v>, <v>Pier 2620</v>, (considerably cheaper, but not the only thing to consider), <v>Courtyard Marriott</v>

I'd say the <v>Tuscan</v>, unless the <v>Courtyard</v> gets you larger rooms or free breakfast.

<v>Taylor Street Coffee Shop</v> is good too.

If you want something spectacular, but not cheap, go to the <v>Garden Court</v> in the <v>Palace Hotel</v>.

<v>Grubsteak</v> is only open 5pm-4am

Across the street from <v>Sears Fine Food</v> is the <v>Sir Francis Drake Hotel</v> with a nice restaurant, <v>Scala's</v> that opens at 7 M-F 

<v>Honey Honey Crepery</v>, mentioned by Dahlia, is another of our choices. I forgot to mention it. Excellent.

One of my favorite cheap, easy and quick breakfast snacks is to go to <v>Chinatown</v> and grab a steamed or baked pork bun and a cup of coffee. 

For a simple, quick breakfast try <v>Barbary Coast Bakery</v> on the corner by <v>Parc 55 hotel</v>.

Breakfast -- <v>Cafe Trieste</v> or <v>Liguria's bakery</v> and there are plenty others around the area.

<v>Chinatown</v> is good for an unsual breakfast -- It is an acquired taste but I guess I acquired it.

<v>Don Pistos</v> (and their newer restaurant, Pistos), is really good for Mexican street food, and it's close by in <v>North Beach</v>.

Other places in <v>North Beach</v>: <v>Tony's</v>, <v>Capo's</v>, <v>Il Casaro</v>, all for pizza, <v>Sotto Mare</v> for seafood.

<v>Molinari</v> and <v>Naked Lunch</v> in <v>North Beach</v> have good sandwiches.

And yeah, we'll probably skip <v>Chinatown</v>, unless we get really homesick within a day of our trip hahaha.

<v>Victoria Pastry</v>, since 1914 serves up some very delicious breakfast goodies. <v>Molinari's</v> for a wine salami sandwich and bottle of wine for a picnic in the very scenic <v>Washington Square</v>. Some many places, so little time.

And yes, we'll be heading towards <v>Fisherman's Wharf</v> so we'll take note of <v>Hollywood Cafe</v>.

<v>Buena vista cafe</v> . Gets more packed as the day progresses

Might want to consider <v>Eagle Cafe</v> too

The <v>bakery on the wharf</v> is nice

Have to agree about the <v>Eagle Cafe</v>...very historic and loads of food with great scenery.

Every time I have gone to the <v>Buena Vista</v> in perhaps the last 20 years they seem really put out that I am ordering food. :(

<v>Pat's Cafe</v> is a nice just off Columbus near the Taylor St. cable car turnaround.

I don't go to the <v>Eagle</v> since it was moved to that abomination they call <v>Pier39</v>.

The <v>Eagle cafe</v> looks great, although I tend to get a bit nervous when restaurants put no prices on their menu.

We had been thinking about the <v>Hollywood Cafe</v>, would you all recommend <v>Eagle</v> over that?

I haven't eaten at the <v>Hollywood cafe</v>, just looked in a couple of times.

I think you would find similar food and prices for both it and <v>Eagle Cafe</v>.

We are travelling to san fran in 2 weeks and staying at the <v>radisson fishermans wharf</v>. 

<V>IHOP</v> is very near your hotel on Beach Street. <v>Boudin Bakery</v> has a café on <v>Pier 39</v> where we have had sourdough toast. The <v>Market Cafe</v> at the <v>Ferry Building</v> if you get the F line trolley.

<v>Cafe Pescatore</v> next to the <v>Tuscan Inn</v>, <v>North Point Street</v> is lovely too.

All the usual breakfast spots will have yogurt/fruit options on the menu. But not lots of choices of it. 
On Chestnut: <v>Judy's</v>, <v>Squat & Gobble</v> (faster, order up front and they bring it to you). 
On Lombard: <v>First Watch</v>, <v>Home Plate</v>.

The <v>Plant Cafe</v> would offer you some good options

Dinner before or after show at the <v>Orpheum Theater</v>?

staying at <v>Hotel Rex</v>. 

<v>Showdogs</v> is a restaurant on Golden Gate/Taylor & Market serving gourmet hotdogs and microbrews;

<v>Hayes Valley</v> is 5 blocks from the <v>Orpheum</v> & has some good pre-theatre choices: 
<v>Absinthe</v> (French), <v>Hayes Grill</v> (Seafood), <v>Stelline</v> (Italian), <v>Citizen Cake</v> (Calif. cuisine + desserts).

<v>Farmer Brown</v> www.farmerbrownsf.com/location.html

Restaurants near <v>Orpheum</v> and <v>Golden Gate Theatre</v>

Here's another vote for <v>Chez Papa Resto</v>. Walking distance from the <v>Golden Gate Theatre</v>.

I have one for you too. <v>Conto do Brazil</v> - I've eaten there several times

you can take BART to 19th street and walk to 354 17th St for <v>Pho 84</v> (meat is served here), a Vietnamese place again.



I only go to Golden Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant (vegan vietnamese food) on Franklin between 13th & 14th St. 

there are some restaurants that you might consider for dinner offering specials, like Luna Park Blue Plate Special.

Check out Goldstar http://www.goldstar.com/home

Brandy Ho's (Chinatown) Other family restaurants also have $ friendly menues.

Assuming by romantic you mean small, cozy, dark, candle-lit, quiet, etc., then I like Da Flora. Also Chez Jacqueline, although the atmosphere is a bit more "bare bones". She does souffles (and salad), and that's it.

Frascati -- very romantic, candles, great food and wine. Powell-Hyde cable car stops at the door.

Seven Hills. You can take a cable car to get there.

there are so many good restaurants, and so many ways people quantify them - Acquarello, Spruce, Boulevard, Jardiniere, Quince, Coi, just a few

I had dinner at Gary Danko two years ago for a birthday

I wouldn't call House of Prime Rib romantic.

It sounds like the top of the mark is a drinks only and then go else where - we are attending an event at Grace Cathedral 

Restaurants around top of the mark?

Just another block away down Taylor is Venticello. 

One of our favourite neighbourhood places is just a very short stroll. No bookings but a great little Italian restaurant -- Nob Hill Café.

And another vote for Venticello. Good service and atmosphere, great food.

Farallon is a very good seafood restaurant in Union Square. :)

There's a good food court at the Westfield Mall, across the street from the cable car terminal at Powell and Market.

Dahlia is absolutely, 100% correct about the cioppino. If you like crab in any form, you MUST try it. 

There are tons of restaurants around Union Square -- is this for lunch or dinner? Not sure what "not super expensive" means to you in terms of dollars but here are some suggestions: 
-Fino's on Post for Italian (don't think they serve lunch). 
-E&O Asian Kitchen (Asian Fusion) on Sutter. 
-Café de la Presse on Bush & Grant (French bistro). 
-Café Claude on Claude Lane (Bush near Kearny), 
-anything on Belden Alley (across Bush and Kearny from Claude Lane).

If you can get over to North Beach -- which isn't far from Union Square -- try the Cioppino at Sotto Mare (Green near Columbus). 

Simba have you been to The Melt for their grilled cheese sandwiches ?

Chinita The melt is a bit exp for a sandwich and a bit oily but it is worth a try

Fino has very good food and is very cozy. Make sure you make reservations because of the limited seating.
