issue:
-multiple locations returned by 4 squre
	- most mismatches for chains

solutions:

	-exact name matching:
		-trade
		-za	
		-Brick and Mortar
	-edit distance?
		
	-more specific lat-long data?
	-look for secondary location data
		-street names
		-if multiple venues, is one unambigous?
	
	-look for type data
		-"drink"
		-"eat"
		-"trampolines"
