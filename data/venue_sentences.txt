<v>Parish Cafe</v> on Boylston Street would be great for a nice day like today.

(After 4.5 months of 70 hr weeks of managing at <v>Craigie</v>, I decided to move on - and that restaurants might not be for me.)

Let's go to <v>Trina's</v>, because there's a small chance I'm going to the bar at <v>Oleana</v> this weekend.

I realize we never confirmed on timing for tonight at <v>Trina's</v>.

How about breakfast at <v>City Table</v> in the Lenox on Thursday the 16th?

How about <v>1369</v> or <v>Life Alive</v>?

Or <v>Trina's</v>?

<v>venue Derby</v> is definitely easy for me, but something potentially more convenient for you is this place in Arlington VA: http://www.yelp.com/biz/screwtop-wine-bar-arlington-2 It's right on the orange line metro and I can get to where I'm going afterward in DC from either place easily.

How about getting dinner at <v>Oleana</v> next Tuesday night at 7:30pm?

Like 6:30 or so at <v>wynkoop</v> or <v>osteria Marco</v>?

Can you come to my neck of the woods, say <v>Sorelle</v> on Congress street?

The <v>Parish Cafe</v> sounds great!

Places around South Station that I suggest for business lunches: 
- <v>Les Zygomates</v> (between South Station and Chinatown) 
- <v>Good Life</v> (between South Station and Downtown Crossing) 
- <v>Kingston Station</v> (between South Station and Downtown Crossing) 
- <v>Lucky's</v> (Congress Street, Fort Point Channel) 
- <v>Cafe 300</v> / <v>Channel Cafe</v> (Summer Street, Fort Point Channel) 
- <v>Papagayo</v>, Mexican (Summer Street, Fort Point Channel) 
- <v>Hai La Moon</v> for dim sum (between bus station and Chinatown) 
Plus some other options, generally more expensive than the above: 
- <v>Trade</v>, probably would require reservation (one block from South Station) 
- <v>Papagayo</v>, Mexican (about three blocks from South Station, away from downtown) 
- <v>Empire</v>, haven't been there but sounds interesting (by the Courthouse) 
- <v>Strega - Waterfront</v> (by the Courthouse) 
- <v>Legal Harborside</v> (past the World Trade Center) 
- <v>Legal Test Kitchen</v> (past the World Trade Center)

If it is last minute and <v>burger king</v>.

We'll be at the <v>weissbrauhaus</v> at about 7:30

We're going have a drink at <v>piratenhohle</v> at around 10 if you want to come

I had a pretty nice meal at <v>Firebrand Saints</v>, and also at <v>Za</v>.

my favorite place on Salem St is <v>Neptune</v>

How about <v>1369</v> or <v>Life Alive</v>?

I like <v>Taranta</v> in the North End.

Theres always <v>chipotle</v> :)

I'd probably go to <v>Chipotle</v> at like 3:30, but we can meet there whenever.

We can try getting into <v>Bondir</v>, its in Cambridge too

Tuesday, Feb 11th 12pm at <v>JM Curley</v> it is.

These days I like <v>Belly Wine Bar</v> at One Kendall.

Options: <v>Row 34</v>, <v>Blue Ginger</v>, <v>Bee's Knee's</v>, <v>Flour</v>

<v>City Table</v> on Thursday the 16th works.

don't go to <v>Mikes Pastry</v>

Anybody want to go to <v>Old Chicago</v> and grab a beer or two?

Next weekend (the 19th) is the last weekend <v>Sunday River</v> is open.

I had a pretty nice meal at <v>Firebrand Saints</v>, and also at <v>Za</v>.

How about <v>Mulan</v>?

How about <v>Boston Common Coffee</v> on High Street, just 2 blocks from South Station.

And, if no <v>Foxwood's</v>, lunch on Wed, right?

Are we still on for lunch to day at noon at <v>Stephi's</v>?

Any chance you can meet somewhere downtown instead of Kendall, say <v>Petit Robert Central</v> (same building as the downtown crossing T) or <v>Trade</v> (nearby to South Station)?

How about <v>Boston Common Coffee</v> on High Street, just 2 blocks from South Station.

At <v>Miracle of Science Bar & Grill</v>

If Kendall area is okay, how about <v>State Park</v> or <v>Belly</v>?

I like <v>Island Creed Oyster</v> in Kenmore Square.

Are you thinking of <v>One of the Kind</v>? 

Very Good Tamale at <v>Blanca's Bakery</v>, 85B Broadway Somerville 

We will probably go to <v>east ocean</v> or <v>gourmet dumpling</v>.

Ugh, <v>Zaftigs</v>!

See you at 7p at <v>Belly</v>.

Heya - any thoughts about <v>Foxwood's</v> next Tuesday?

How about <v>Daily Catch</v>?

Maybe at <v>Regal Beagle</v>?

I know there's a <v>Starbucks</v> in Central, that could work.

Leave for <v>Meadhall</v> at 5:30?

If so, maybe <v>JM Curley</v>?

I just looked at Yelp and saw a place called the <v>Red Derby</v>....a bar that is closer to where you are and outside the city center.

How about 9:15am at the <v>Starbucks</v> at the corner of prospect and mass ave.?

Great, how about coffee at 2pm on the 20th at <v>Barrington Roasters</v> on Congress Street in Fort Point Channel?

For sure, how about <v>Oleana's bar</v>?

Hey would you rather meet at the <v>old Chicago</v> in broomfield?

<v>Moksa</v> is not one of my favorite places.

<v>Blackhawk Friday</v> night?

We will probably go to <v>east ocean</v> or <v>gourmet dumpling</v>.

Kayla wants to try to go to <v>Little India</v> for dinner

We could go to <v>nordstrom Rack</v>

We are going to grab a drink at <v>Shojo</v> on Tyler street

Have you been to <v>Row 34</v>?

Or at <v>mit's library</v> maybe

We could go to the <v>dark horse</v>

I think we want <v>Hayden library</v>.

Wanna go to <v>tuk tuk</v>?!

Night skiing at <v>Keystone</v>?

And <v>Life Alive</v> or <v>1369</v> would be perfect.

How about Tuesday Feb 11th at noon at <v>JM Curley</v>?

We could do a hot yoga class at <v>prana</v>?

Fri night @ <v>chilis</v> after tumbling?

And go to <v>sunapee</v>?

Would the same plan work for you of 9:15am at <v>Life Alive</v> on Thursday?

I know of a little place called <v>starlite lounge</v> that serves some awesome cocktails.

let's do the <v>Starlite lounge</v> that sounds perfect and congratulations!

How about <v>row 34</v>?

<v>Bay Point Restaurant</v> in Quincy is nice for a group

How about the <v>Starbucks</v> at Levi Plaza

We had originally plan for November 12 at noon at <v>Stephi's</v>.

Happy to meet and chat more - scheduling is a near and dear topic to my heart given how much time I have wasted on it :) Want to meet at the <v>starbucks</v> across from South Station next Mon at 130pm?

Yeah, <v>mit library</v> would be cool, if we can get on the wifi there?

You still down to go to <v>black hawk</v> tonight

Cross country skiing tomorrow at <v>keystone</v>?

The game is at 2:30 at <v>Sports Authority Field</v>.

Head count for who wants to go to <v>Rock Bottom</v> in Westminster!

Want to grab lunch at <v>Mulan</v>?

7:30 <v>wynkoop</v> sounds good

Love <v>EVOO</v> and <v>Catalyst</v>. Maybe <v>Abigail's</v> as another option?

wanna get some sandwiches at <v>Commonwealth</v>?

<v>Banh Mi Ba Le</v> in Dorchester is even better, but is quite a hike.

I used to go to <v>Gourmet Decisions</v> for breakfast a lot.

Go to <v>Neptune</v> and get a lobster roll.

wanna visit <v>88 food court</v> on Comm. Ave, get two banh mi at <v>Pho Viet's</v>?

In the North End, try <v>La Summa</v>, <v>Cantina Italiana</v>, <v>Massimino's</v> or <v>Pizzeria Regina</v>.

<v>Kantin</v> has some very fine cantonese - i like their chow foon.

You're welcome to join, or I'll just meet you at <v>legal sea foods</v> around 4.

Chinatown is my favorite place to eat in Boston: <v>Peach Farm</v>, <v>Gourmet Dumpling House</v>, <v>New Shanghai</v>, <v>Asian Garden</v>, <v>Best Little Restaurant</v>, <v>Great Taste restaurant</v>, <v>Xinh Xinh</v> and <v>Pho Pasteur</v> (both for Vietnamese and wonderful Pho), <v>Shabu Shabu at Q</v> restaurant, or <v>Kaze</v>.

There are loads of good restaurants in the South End--try <v>Toro</v>, <v>Coppa</v>, <v>Franklin Cafe</v>.

5:30 at <v>dunstan</v>?

So here are some ideas - dinner and/or drinks Or maybe.... - trampolines pizza and music (Saturdays at <v>skyzone</v>).

Yeah, next Friday for lunch at <v>sweetgreen</v>

How about <v>Trattoria di Monica</v> on Prince Street

Would <v>Fiorella's</v> in Newton be too far? 

How about <v>Oren's hummus shop</v>?

Also, I'm toying with the idea of going to <v>Foxwood's</v> on Tuesday to play in a tournament at 6pm (my girlfriend is out of town).

If Central Square is an option, maybe <v>Brick and Mortar</v> or <v>Green Street Grill</v>?

Which <v>chilis</v>?

In Kendall, I could do <v>Firebrand Saints</v> or maybe the bar at <v>Evoo</v>.

Staying at the <v>kimpton</v> downtown for a conference.

I'll be right near <v>Firebrand Saints</v> - let's plan for a bit after 6.

How about 3:30pm at <v>Barrington Coffee Roasters</v>?

So a trip to <v>davidsons</v> today?

Karl -- <v>Papagayo</v> can get surprisingly busy, so I recommend a reservation.

Apparently at <v>TD garden</v>.

The Mexican place (<v>Papagayo</v>) looks good.

Heya - any thoughts about <v>Foxwood's</v> next Tuesday?

Let's do <v>Swiss</v> bakery. 

How about <v>Mulan</v>?

Wanna rally the troops and go to <v>little India</v>?

Just to let you know again, yes we are still down for <v>sandtrap mines</v>.

If you go into Cambridge at all you might want to try the <v>Friendly Toast</v> for breakfast.

I like the <v>Daily Catch</v> ... on Hanover Street in the North End and on Northern Ave.

If not, I can still do <v>Firebrand</v>.

Options: <v>Row 34</v>, <v>Blue Ginger</v>, <v>Bee's Knee's</v>, <v>Flour</v>

I will be taking Neil to his scratch programming class next Sunday at around 2:30 and we should talk later to see if Spencer is interested for the next session at <v>Einsteins</v> and we could car pool their activities.

I am skiing <v>Bolton Valley</v> today!

I don't know anything about <v>Bee's Knees</v>.

Let's do Wednesday the 22nd at <v>life alive</v>, 9:15.

I take Neil out to <v>Einstein's</v> at around 2:15-2:30 for his class at 3:15.

I'll probably stop for <v>Chipotle</v> before.

Do you want to meet outside the <v>legal sea foods</v> in Kendall and find our way from there?

(<v>Rock Bottom Brewery</v> at 104th and 36?)

gonna stop by <v>Formaggio</v> later.

I really like <v>Beantown Taqueria</v>.

want to try the <v>Local</v> or the <v>Dolphin</v>?

<v>Ritu Ki Rasoi</v> does a Sat/Sun lunch buffet from noon to 3. 

How about the <v>Local</v> in Wayland or Wellesley?

meet you at <v>Bamboo</v>, around 5:00?

<v>Changsho</v> in Cambridge has a Sunday brunch buffet with supposedly all you can eat lobster. 

We had originally plan for November 12 at noon at <v>Stephi's</v>.

Are we still on for lunch to day at noon at <v>Stephi's</v>?

Let's go to <v>Trina's</v>, because there's a small chance I'm going to the bar at <v>Oleana</v> this weekend.

My dad and I are hiking <v>mount Elbert</v>.

Like 6:30 or so at <v>wynkoop</v> or <v>osteria Marco</v>?

<v>Pub X</v>, 8pm, Thurs?

How's 2:30 at <v>barrington coffee roasters</v> on congress street?

Dr. Irena Maier on Friday, October 4, 2013, at the <v>Kenmore Endoscopy Center</v>, located on the 1st floor of the <v>Harvard Vanguard Kenmore Office</v>

I'll also be taking evening classes for a VEE in economics next month at <v>UMass</v>.

Gala is Tuesday, and we should go to <v>Jose's</v> beforehand

I made a reservation for <v>Jose's</v> for tomorrow night at 7.

We have a reservation at the <v>Grafton Street Pub & Grill</v>, in Harvard Sq.  We can fine-tune the plan later!

If you don't feel like going to the campus and would like to get some work done, we could go to in <v>Cafe on the Common</v> in Waltham.

No plans Sat. night, and I don't think we've discussed this with Kristin. Maybe we could go to <v>Harbour Court</v> (NYYC) in Newport for dinner?  Also there are lots of great restaurants in Providence.

How about <v>NY Pizzeria</v> for lunch?  Another preference?  We could go to <v>Teala's</v> on Dallas.

Magically, <v>Oleana</v> has availability for 2 at 7:30pm on Thursday. We could go there. I booked the reservation just in case :) 

We could go someplace in Harvard and then go to <v>Finale</v> after dinner for cake.

We could go to <v>Silvertone</v>, its right near the park st T and would be convenient for people walking there and those on the red line. Its a neat place! 

Marge and I had floated the idea of going out and grabbing drinks in the north end somewhere. I can confirm that the <v>fiore</v> roof deck bar has a particularly fantastic sangria.

<v>Fiore</v> is pretty awesome... And the sangria comes in pitchers! 

Please mark your calendars and make your plans now to join us at 12:00 p.m. on the 23rd at the <v>Tower Club</v> on the 48th floor of Thanksgiving Tower in downtown Dallas, 1601 Elm Street.  

We will begin over lunch, work through the afternoon planning the organization and first activities of the Institute, and conclude with drinks and an early dinner at the <v>Tower Club</v>.

The Pretty Vacant drink at <v>Tommy Doyle's</v> looks delicious and it has Pimms in it which is a request of Sally. 

$5 for $10 Worth of Food and Drink (50% off) @ <v>Boloco</v>

I just found this awesome deal on LevelUp: $5 for $10 Worth of Food and Drink (50% off) @ <v>Boloco</v>

If you can get the required letter and snail mail it to us, maybe we can pick up your season passes for you when we're up at <v>Sunday River</v>

3. Getting a whole bunch of friends up to <v>Sunday River</v> in January for some great skiing.

I'm jealous that you guys still get to ski so often, but luckily ATO ski weekend is coming up soon and I'm working on getting a group together who would want to come up to <v>Sunday River</v> for a day.

We used to ski with Rich & Carol up at <v>Sunday River</v> with the Olsons.

Come share the day with us at <v>Sunday River</v> on T2 serviced by the Locke Mountain Triple starting at 9am and last download at 3:30.

It's a coastal storm, but they're expecting maybe as much as 2-4", (or maybe less, who knows?) of snow at <v>Sunday River</v>, mostly falling tomorrow. So it's possible, but not a sure thing, that you might have fun (probably not epic) ski conditions up there tomorrow afternoon. 

we're going to meet at 6:30 PM at the <v>Watch City Brewing Co</v>. (found here: http://watchcitybrew.com/), enjoy some food and drinks, and generally have a good time!  The restaurant's located on Moody St., so it should be pretty convenient for anyone in the area. 

Anyone who wants to come to yoga, meet at <v>Gantcher</v> at 8 p.m.

Vice yoga 8 pm tomorrow which is Sunday at <v>gantcher</v>.

We need a good dinner to prepare. Lets go to <v>Annas</v>. Meet at Teele at 730? I can drive.

Plan is <v>Sabur</v> at 7! Meet at Teele at 630 for departure. Did we ever resolve the cake issue?

<v>Cottage Park</v> - Up to 28 people (14 boats) meet at ATO at 9:15 for breakfast.

<v>Fairsted Table</v> in Washington Square

<v>Farmstead Table</v> in Newton Center

<v>Sycamore</v> in Newton Center

I haven't heard anything about <v>Orleans</v>, but their menu looked good and I'd trust Dan's opinion. 

New to Tufts University: <v>Adam's Pizza & Pasta Italian Kitchen</v>. 614 Main St

New to Tufts University. <v>Chef Co</v>, 14 Medford St http://www.elabs3.com/ct.html?rtr=on&s=iew,18h23,5bc6,gmbe,bobx,blno,5esu

<v>Gargoyles</v> is also pricey, btw. Last time I was there with my dad, I'm pretty sure I remember paying over 30 dollars an entree...it's good food though...

Basically, we're going to grab dinner at the <v>Watch Factory Brewing Co.</v> (found here: http://watchcitybrew.com/) in Waltham at 6:30 PM.  The restaurant is located on Moody St., so it should be pretty convenient for anyone who's in the area.

I sent out an e-mail a few days ago, but this is just a reminder about the dinner we're having tomorrow night at <v>Watch City Brewing Co</v> in Waltham.

This week, I've chosen <v>Bison County</v> (on Moody St.) as our restaurant.  

It feels as though we've largely exhausted the restaurants in the immediate area, so we're going to nearby Newton for dinner.  The restaurant is called <v>Fiorella's</v> and information about it can be found here: http://www.fiorellasnewton.com/

The restaurant is called <v>Fiorella's</v>. The address of the restaurant is: 187 North St, Newton, MA 02460

you all should come to the new <v>Sound Bites</v> restaurant on Tuesday night.

Half Off at <v>Jose's Mexican Restaurant</v>. We should actually do this one!!!!

I'd be down for dinner tonight. Not really a fan of the Foundry (no  offense Sara) the food is overpriced and I had a poor experience there  Thursday night.

Roisin and I have been looking up menus and we've narrowed it down to two choices. 
<v>Elephant Walk</v> (on Mass Ave w/ parking)  http://www.elephantwalk.com/cambridge/menus/Cambridge_Dinner_Menu_20100808.pdf 
or <v>Sabur</v> (in Teele square) http://www.saburrestaurant.com/menu/dinner.pdf

<v>Dali</v> was fun and different! and it's been a while since they've been there.

Maybe <v>red rock</v> in swampscott?

We asked at a restaurant in Central (<v>Garden at the Cellar</v>) about renting a room for the night, and it was 3,000 dollars not including food.

Next wednesday before senior gala, there is a mass exodus by the sailing team to a little restaurant known as <v>Jose's</v>

<v>Anthony's</v> in the seaport district is a classic.

If you are looking for Sandwiches, <v>Crema Cafe</v> have great food

Another option is <v>Fire & Ice</v> which is right next door to <v>Border Cafe</v>.

If it's a nice day, go to <v>Charlie's Kitchen</v>

<v>Legal Seafood</v> at the Charles Hotel is a good moderate choice.

<v>Bartley's Burger Cottage</v> is so over-run with people, there is always a line to get in. 

<v>Grafton Street Pub</v> is a nice atmosphere and moderately priced.

<v>Russel House</v> is much larger & can be loud (in the tavern sort of way)

while the <v>Red House</v> is comfortable, cozy & really lovely food.

If it's museums only and the <v>Harvard Museum of Natural history</v> is of particular interest

I'd recommend the <v>New England aquarium</v> is you like to see sea life.

I'd recommend the <v>Natural History museum</v> is you like natural history, 

I'd recommend the <v>Museum of Fine art</v> if you like to see fine art

I'd recommend the <v>Museum of Science</v> if you like science

I'd recommend the <v>Institute of Contemporary art</v> is you like contemporary art

I'd recommend the <v>JFK museum</v> if you have an interest in JFK

The <v>Miracle of Science Bar and Grill</v> is a good spot.

Or you can go across the street to the Student Center for <v>Anna's Tacqueria</v>.

There are other lunch options in the Kendall Square area as well, including <v>Cosi</v> for sandwiches.

I just ate at <v>Area Four</v> in Kendall Square this past weekend and it was good (we had pizza).

But if you do end up in East Cambridge, head up the street to the <v>Atwood's Tavern</v>

if you do end up in East Cambridge, head down to Kendall Square for <v>Lord Hobo</v>.

if you do end up in East Cambridge, head down to Kendall Square for <v>Meadhall</v>.

if you do end up in East Cambridge, head down to Kendall Square for <v>Cambridge Brewing Company</v>.

<v>Bartley's</v> does not take reservations. 

<v>East Side bar and Grille</v> and <v>Mr. bartley's</v> might be good options. 

<v>Mr. Bartleys</v> will be slammed during the races, and it is small. 

A decent breakfast spot not too far outside Harvard Square is <v>Zoe's</v>. It is a reasonably priced Greek diner type place on Mass Ave with an extensive menu.

I like <v>Pizzaria Regina</v> on Thatcher Street in the North End.

<v>Fig's</v> on Charles Street in Boston and also in Charlestown.

<v>Upper Crust</v> (various locations, including Cambridge, I think)

And for 'pan pizza', <v>Galleria Umberto</v>, Hanover Street, North End. 

My half-Neapolitan son raves about <v>Area Four</v> and has on occasion brought some home for his parents.

The best pizza in Cambridge is technically in Somerville at <v>Posto Pizza</v> across the parking lot from Porter Square.

<v>Cambridge One</v> in Harvard Square and Otto in Coolidge Corner (Brookline) are both top notch.

the closest I've had to the pizza served in Naples is <v>Angela's</v> coal-fired pizza in Saugus.

I'd suggest <v>Santarpio's</v>.

<v>East Side Bar and Grill</v>. Cambridge St. East Cambridge. Great pizza

For good US style pizza - <v>Regina's</v>. 

For true Neapolitan style pizza, <v>Gran Gusto</v> in Cambridge. 

I also like <v>Il Posto</v> in Somerville.

<v>Gran Gusto</v> looks really good - I used to work next door at 86 Sherman Street but that was 10 years ago - it wasn't there back then!

Boston - <v>Pizzeria Regina</v> on Thatcher Streeet

Cambridge - I like <v>Area Four</v>

I can recommend <v>Rendezvous</v> in Central Square

I would second the choice of <v>Rendezvous</v> if you go to Central Sq.

Possibly walk eastward along the Charles River, head inland on Massachusetts Avenue at the MIT campus, and get something to eat at the <v>Flour Bakery</v>.

If you can walk a little further the <v>Friendly Toast</v> at 1 Kendall Square is a popular spot with lots of breakfast options. 

If you don't mind a walk, I would suggest walking over to 3rd Street west of Binney Street, where the <v>Voltage Coffehouse</v> is located.

If you don't mind a walk, I would suggest walking over to 3rd Street west of Binney Street, where the <v>Tatte Bakery</v> is located.

There's a <v>Starbucks</v> in the <v>Cambridgeside Galleria</v> shopping mall across the street from your hotel.

<v>Henrietta's Table</v> is a nice spot for a special breakfast. It's at the <v>Charles Hotel</v> right at Harvard Square.

A bit further away on Mass ave towards Central square, there's <v>Zoe's</v>. It's a Greek/American retro diner.

The <v>Peabody Essex Museum</v> is Salem's gem. 

The <v>Cape Ann Museum</v> is close to the station and features maritime history and art. It's one of my favorite places on Cape Ann.

Visit the colonial and late 18th century America exhibits in the <v>Museum of Fine Arts</v>' new Arts of the Americas wing.

I feel like <v>Stella</v> is certainly missing.

<v>Eastern Standard</v>?  I'd rather go to <v>Chili's</v>.

I like <v>Eastern Standard</v>, but more for the cocktails than the food.

Ya i was surprised by <v>Eastern Standard</v> too. Their cocktails are good, but the food isn't great.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the <v>Citizen</v>, the <v>Gallows</v>, and <v>East by Northeast</v> on there

Maybe a suburban restaurants, like <v>Alta Strada</v>, <v>L'Andana</v> and <v>Blue Ginger</v>.

<v>Ten Tables Cambridge</v>, <v>Posto</v> or <v>Oishii Boston</v>. I mostly like those places. 

I've never been to <v>80 Thoreau</v>.

Some Japanese options: <v>O Ya</v>, <v>Uni</v>, <v>Umai</v>, and <v>Oishii</v>.

<v>Toro</v> was our third and best stop so far. 

Overall, <v>Giacomo’s Ristorante</v> is a solid Italian restaurant. 

<v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> is a classy restaurant by all means and has a great variety to back it up. 

It may not be the best restaurant in Boston, but I think <v>Eastern Standard Kitchen</v> has a lot of legitimate potential.

Sounds good. See you at noon at <v>Dumpling Cafe</v>.

Thursday works.  How about 2pm at <v>Barrington Coffee Roasting Company</v>?

Lunch tomorrow at <v>area four</v>

Better make it Wednesday. 1pm at <v>DiFara</v>?

Peking Duck at <v>Great China</v> in Berkeley

The peking duck at <v>1889</v> was indeed really good.

Hey guys, I was wondering if you all might be interested in going to have Peking Duck at <v>Great China</v>.

Saturday at <v>Normas Burgers</v> 1200 pm

Am here and planning on meeting you tomorrow, 10 am at <v>Starbucks</v>?

Sure, 10 am? <v>Starbuck</v> at 38th?

Let's plan to meet at <v>Manhattan Sandwich Co</v> at 7am tomorrow.

I wanted to know if you wanted to grab a drink this Friday at <v>Manny's bar</v>

Would you like to meet for drinks Friday night at <v>Applebee's</v>?

Would you like to meet me at the <v>red horse</v> at 10 on Friday (test)

How about the <v>Starbucks</v> at Levi Plaza

Do you want to grab a drink Friday at <v>Lily's</v>? (Usertesting)

Yeah, next Friday for lunch at <v>sweetgreen</v>

Or if you're looking for a cheaper/simpler option we can do <v>S&S</v>, also in Inman

Anybody interested in going to the state championship football game to watch Lakewood tomorrow? The game is at 2:30 at <v>Sports Authority Field</v>.

Yes! Apparently at <v>TD garden</v>.

Yes, we're still on for tonight and I'm looking forward to it! See you at 7p at <v>Belly</v>.

Thursday afternoon is good. I've got a meeting from 2-3pm. How about 3:30pm at <v>Barrington Coffee Roasters</v>?

How about breakfast/coffee tomorrow at 7am at the <v>Nine Zero</v>?

How about <v>1369</v> or <v>Life Alive</v>?

I was talking to some folks who are camping out at <v>Highland Capital</v> on 16.

I bought a Henri Lloyd suit, the only one at <v>Marblehead Marine Outfitters</v> that fit me.  

THE CLUB S TICKET OFFICE AT <v>FENWAY PARK</v> FOR A REFUND OF THE FACE VALUE OF THE TICKET ONLY. 

Barmasters TONIGHT at <v>Powderhouse Pub</v>!

I sailed some regatta at MIT one weekend where the wind was gusting over 40

Anyhow I was wondering who was interested in doing a little sailing at the lake around 4:30/5 this evening then head to <v>Redbones</v> for dinner

I won't be done with work in time but I'd love to meet up for <v>redbones</v>. 

Happy Birthday. I can't make the lake but I am so down for <v>Redbones</v>.

So I think we should all meet ~7:30 at 211 to head to <v>Redbones</v>.

A few of us were talking about how we havent tried <v>Gargoyles</v>, the <v>Foundry</v> and <v>Flatbread</v>.

And then theres the classic <v>Redbones</v>. 

Or we could keep it simple and do <v>Annas</v>. 

<v>Posto</v> is good, pricey but good. 

<v>Gargoyles</v> or <v>Redbones</v> in <v>Davis</v>? 

<v>Wagamama</v> or <v>Grendles Den</v> in Harvard?

<v>Redbones</v>/ underbones could be a good choice! Although I get BBQ all the time in TX. Haha, really anywhere in Davis works for me.

Vicki votes for <v>Anna's</v>.

<v>Anna's Taqueria</v> orders for Wednesday:

Not as exciting as the Burritos from <v>Anna's</v> last eve 

I work across the street from <v>Anna's</v> so that's an option too.

If you'll be sailing on Shout this Wednesday, please give me your dinner order from the <v>Anna's</v> menu (http://www.annastaqueria.com/lunch_and_dinner.html) by 9 am on Wednesday.

Okay. Colin, vicki and I say meet at <v>Anna's</v> in Davis at 7:30.

Man, it's been a while since I built an <v>Annas</v> dinner...  Can I get a super burrito with cheese, chicken, rice, lettuce and onion?  No beans please.

There's an <v>Annas</v> on the Mit campus...

<v>ANNAS</v> FOR DINNER!!!!!

We need a good dinner to prepare. Lets go to <v>Annas</v>.

Is anyone coming to <v>annas</v> with me :(? 

although the close pretty early so that may not work out...theres always <v>annas</v>...

<v>WAGAMAMA</v>!!! Has the massage already been covered? I would go in on that as well.

Hola - lets meet up for lunch at <v>Yank Sing</v> at the Rincon next Friday.

Hopefully you'll come out here again for some skiing at <v>Squaw Valley</v>.

The Best team will receive Lunch @ <v>Mothers Bistro</v> (by the end of October)

Breakfast -- <v>In a Pickle</v> -- 9:00 am -- Monday

Let's start a break with a nice breakfast in <v>In a pickle</v>. Let's meet there (265 Moody St, Waltham) around 9:00 am.

Breakfast in Falmouth from <v>Pickle Jar</v>

The idea was formed on Thursday to start a week by going for breakfast to the most amazing breakfast place in Waltham called <v>In a pickle</v>.

<v>In a pickle</v> is located really close to the Waltham stop of the commuter rail, so no need to see more Waltham than you'd like.

Could I just confirm with you the time you were thinking we could all meet for breakfast at <v>In a Pickle</v>?

I know I've told you I (and maybe my wife) would be there <v>In a Pickle</v>, but I'm really sorry that I turned out not to be able to make it today.

If you are more in the mood to dance, <v>Le Queen</v> (Champs Elysee) and <v>Rex Club</v> are the two go to establishments that non-locals can get in, however be prepared for long lines and very expensive drinks. 

A fun alternative is <v>Rue de Lappe</v> near the Bastille. 

Our favorite bar here was <v>L'Objectif Lune</v> - it has awesome drink specials.

If you are in the 6th or 7th (near St Germaine des Pres) there is an AMAZING souffle restaurant you HAVE to go to. Its called <v>Le Cigale Recalmier</v>.

<v>Le Dauphin</v> (9eme Arrondissement) - Innovative French tapas

<v>Lao Lane Xang 2</v> (Place d'Italie - this is the China town of Paris)

<v>Chez Gladine</v> (Place d'Italie) - Affordable, good French food

<v>Hotel du Nord</v> (Canal St. Martin)

<v>Zerda Cafe</v> (10eme Arrdondissement near Republique) - North African. Couscous is super popular in Paris right now

<v>L'as du Falafel</v> (4eme arrondissement) - Cheap and excellent falaffel place in the Marais

<v>Au Refuge des Fondues</v> (Montmartre) - Small hipstery fondue place where you drink wine out of baby bottles.

<v>La Patisserie des Reves</v> (16eme arrondissement near Trocadero) - BEST FREAKIN' bakery in Paris

<v>Da Carmine</v> (Montmartre) if you are looking for pizza

Check out the boutiques in <v>Montmatre</v> or the <v>Marais</v> (4th district = gay/Jewish neighborhood) as they'll be trendy and not available in the US.

Shopping at the <v>Galleries LaFayette</v> can be fun be since the sales in Paris are over, will be expensive.

Dinner in <v>Montmartre</v> around 8pm at <v>Au Refuge des Fondues</v> (depending on numbers you may need a reservation in French, its super small).

Then head back down to <v>Pigalle</v>, stopping for shots at <v>Le Krelim bar</v> and then making your way while bar hopping either to <v>L'Epoque</v> for karoake (and a giraffe de biere - a huge yard type carafe of beer).

And the French drink at <v>Grendle's den</v> also looks delicious and Sally was in France. Let me know.

<v>Allard</v>, 6th - 41, rue Saint Andr√© des Arts (01.43.26.48.23) Extremely authentic.

<v>Wadja</v>, 6th - 10, rue de la Grande-Chaumi√®re (01 46 33 02 02) Simple, really French Bistro.  Montparnasse.

Close to <v>Luxembourg Gardens</v>.

<v>Au Chateaubriand</v>, 11th - 129, avenue Parmentier (01. 43.57.45.95)

<v>Chic</v>, relaxed, hip-ish young Paris neighborhood. Good wine and good food, simple menu.

<v>Le Bistro Paul Bert</v>, 11th - 18, rue Paul Bert (01 43 72 24 01) Informal, with good food. Request table in front rooms, not back.

<v>Le Pamphlet</v>, 3rd - 38, rue Debelleyme (01 42 72 39 24) Gastronomic, intimate.

<v>La Maison Blanche</v>, 8th - 15, av Montaigne (01 47 23 55 99) Gastronomic, chic, great view. And a little fancier - right bank but west.

Friday Dinner likely at <v>La Civetta</v> in Falmouth - http://www.osterialacivetta.com

Dinner Sat eve is at <v>CRU Rezzies</v> at Six

A few early arrivals are getting together tonight at <v>PJ Ryan's</v> in Teele Square.

First round is on me at <v>pj ryans</v>! Meet at teele at 915 and we'll head out.

<v>Pj ryans</v>. Trivia night at 10, anyone interested?

*Where*: <v>Bistro 5</v> in Medford (My parents will figure out some way to get us there...prob taxis i guess)

The event will be at one of the local tufts bars (<v>Burren</v>, <v>J-Tree</v>, or <v>Sagra</v>) on an off-night where the bar usually does not have much of a night scene.

So I just won a happy hour party at <v>McFadden's</v>, this sweet bar in government center.

What: iPhone When: Saturday, November 9, 2013 at 11:30 AM Where: <v>Apple Store</v>, CambridgeSide

It's this Sat night at the <v>Radisson Hotel Astrodome</v>

<v>J.J. Foley's</v> is a true Irish-American pub, bar and restaurant, offering the best authentic Irish pub food in Boston.

Yes! And then we ran into each other at <v>Tatte</v> like 20 times after that :)

another alternative would be to go get a drink at our favorite bar <v>Cheshire</v>, walk to the nearby delicious delicious <v>napa woodfired pizza</v>.

those are from the <v>Soggy Dollar Beach Bar</v> at White Bay on Jost Van Dyke  - which just happens to be where we are now.

Yes, there's still a considerable wait at <v>Rino's</v>, except around when they open. 

Also in that area is <v>Grotto</v>, which is a bit higher-end Italian, but very tasty.

I think the place Bob is trying to remember is <v>Antonio's</v> on Cambridge St. It's very good actually. 

<v>Antonio's</v> -- Bingo! Thank you.

I looked up <v>Antonio's</v> and it sounds delicious! 

<v>Antonio's</v> is great and definitely walkable from Long Wharf. 

<v>Rino's</v> is in a class all by itself. The wait times are considerable, but the food is off the charts good. I'm going tomorrow - so excited!

Since you're staying at the Westin, the <v>Legal Seafoods</v> at Copley Place is probably going to be closest

much quieter and more relaxing than the <v>Legal Seafoods</v> at <v>Prudential Center</v>.

I would go with The <v>Summer Shack</v>, 50 Dalton St. Excellent seafood, casual atmosphere. Outstanding choice of oysters. 

<v>Myers + Chang</v> has some of the best Asian dishes in the South End.

<v>Toro</v> has wonderful Tapas and other Spanish theme dishes.

Earlier in the week we had lunch on the patio at <v>Coppa Enoteca</v>.

I have to agree. My husband and I had a wonderful brunch on the patio at <v>Hamersley's</v> yesterday.

you could try <v>Teranga</v>. It's a Senagalese restaurant.

An old standby in the South End is <v>Hammersley's Bistro</v>. It leans French, but is not real traditional French. Take a look at the menu.

the <v>Revere</v> isn't far from the South End. 

We love <v>Tremont 647</v>, Chef Andy Husbands is a really talented guy and it is a lively atmosphere. 

<v>Mike's City Diner</v> is a great place for breakfast :

<v>Flour Bakery & Cafe</v> also great for breakfast & lunch:

To add to the restaurant list, my South End favorite is a simple place with fantastic pizza: <v>PICCO</v>.

the <v>Revere</v> is a sleek cool hotel which you may regret not choosing if you check it out.

Maybe <v>Sonsie</v>? http://sonsieboston.com/flash/

Go to the <v>Marliave</v>. They have a lovely outdoor patio, or if that's filled, the first floor inside is really nice, with a tin ceiling, and a giant antique bar. 

Kate are you thinking of the <v>Landing on Long Wharf</v>? It's part of Boston Harbor Cruises.

Kate is the <v>Reef</v>? that is a great suggestion!

I'd be more inclined to get something from <v>Mike's Pastry</v> in the North End for a sweet treat.

The <v>Parker House</v> is also noted for the Parker House Roll. 

Meal in the North End capped off with a dessert from <v>Mikes</v> or <v>Modern Pastry</v>.

Definitely do the <v>Freedom Trail</v>. If you want to get max benefit and entertainment, take a guided tour.

<v>Teatro</v>, <v>PF Chang's</v>, <v>Rustic Kitchen</v> and there are a few others in the area. 

If you like Thai food, <v>Montien</v> on Stuart Street is another good choice.

How about <v>Jacob Wirth</v> on Stuart Street: http://www.jacobwirth.com/menus/dinner

the <v>Paramount</v> on Charles Street in Beacon Hill might fit the bill:

You may want to eat near the airport. <v>Donna's restaurant</v> in East Boston has exactly what you want and will be quiet early in the morning.

anyway, we're staying at the <v>Red Roof Inn</v> in Saugus

So here's one suggestion. You can drive to <v>Mike's City Diner</v> in Boston's South End. Since it's a Sunday, if you get there early in the morning.

<v>Toro</v> is one of the most highly regarded tapas restaurants in Boston. They serve a wonderful Sunday brunch, but it doesn't start until 10:30am.

<v>Skywalk Observatory</v> at The <v>Prudential Center</v>/Tower - may consider lunch or drinks at Tob of the Hub instead / as well.

Went to <v>Blue Dragon</v> last weekend...very good

Some suggestions in the area: 
<v>Blue Dragon</v>, <v>Toro</v>, <v>Estragon</v> (both Tapas places), 
<v>Tapeo</v>, <v>Cuchi Cuchi</v> (loads of fun, great drinks), 
<v>Puritan and Co</v>, <v>Piattini</v>, <v>Sarma</v> (Turkish mezze...excellent, highly recommend).

Just went to <v>Sarma</v> a few weeks ago - yum!

<v>Coppa</v> (same chef as <v>Toro</v>) does fabulous small plates & recently winner of the James Beard award! 

If you want a strictly Seafood restaurant with little to no meat on the menu, you could try <v>Row 34</v> in Fort Point.

<v>Sportello</v> can be Italian small plates since they offer all their pastas as half portions.

<v>West Bridge</v> in Kendall Sq.?

Add <v>Kika</v> to the list for tapas if you're in the Kendall Square area of Cambridge .

Another place to consider is <v>Fairsted Kitchen</v> in Brookline:

My favorites, of the places already mentioned, are <v>Cuchi Cuchi</v>, <v>Kika</v> and <v>Sarma</v>. 

<v>Oleana</v> (sister restaurant to <v>Sarma</v>) also has a lot of small plates on their menu

and <v>Dali</v> is a very good standard Spanish tapas place in Inman Square in Cambridge

The <v>Capital Grill</v> or <v>Grill 23</v> are both really nice.

For a steakhouse, I'd take them to <v>Grille 23</v>; for seafood, the second floor of <v>Legal Harborside</v> (great view) or <v>Oceanaire</v>.

Otherwise, if you know they like beef, one of the high end steakhouses, like <v>Grill 23</v> or the <v>Capital Grille</v>.

<v>Ruth's</v> Chris in the Old Boston City Hall are all very nice.

<v>Del Frisco's</v> is another option if you want a harbor view while you eat.

The <v>Bristol Lounge</v> is the restaurant at the Four Seasons. 

<v>Bistro du Midi</v> is in the Heritage on the Garden Building on the next block.

<v>Menton</v> and <v>L'Espalier</v> both have the option for lengthy fine dining dinners.

For casual - <v>Yankee Lobster</v> or <v>James Hook</v> are two good choices.

You could also try the <v>Barking Crab</v>, which has a full bar. 

There's <v>Boston Beer Works</v> and <v>Cask n Flagon</v> right next to the park.

<v>Eastern Standard</v> is a nice place for food & drinks. It's right on Kenmore Square and around the corner from the field.

I usually go to <v>Boston Beer Works</v> before the game and then <v>Cask n Flagon</v> after the game for a few drinks. Lots of choices around there!

<v>Eastern Standard</v> rocks - this place is also very good:

<v>Cask n' flagon</v> tends to get very busy on game day including most bars in the area.

I really like the <v>Yard House</v> before the game because they have a patio and if you go between 3-6, there half-off appetizer deal

<v>Masa</v> in the South End came to my mind first for Tapas, but it's not really on the way. 

I like <v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v>. Great drinks and bartenders, very tasty food -- try a burger with fried oysters on top. Mmmmm!

<v>Atlantic Fish</v> on Boylston Street

<v>Atlantic Fish</v> is not the place to go if you have a fish allergy! 

<v>Rabia's</v> in the North End. They actually have two separate and full menus. One Italian and one Seafood.

One good seafood restaurant, that is not often mentioned here, is <v>Oceanaire</v>.

Take the Blue Line to Wonderland and go to <v>Kelly's Roast Beef</v> on Revere Beach.

I would like to recommend <v>Bistro du Midi</v> which has a Provencal French menu.

You might consider trying <v>Bugaboo Creek</v>, which has a similar menu but a Canadian (as opposed to Australian) theme

<v>Randolph</v> is actually pretty close to Boston

There are a lot of restaurants in that area. One that comes to mind is the <v>Salty Dog</v>. I've eaten there at least a couple of times. 
I didn't expect much because it is such a touristy area, but the food was actually pretty good.

<v>Durgin Park</v> or <v>Ned Devine's</v> would be fine. <v>Ned Devine's</v> also has seating upstairs and outside.

I second The <v>Salty Dog</v>. It's quite good considering it's location.

If you like Tex Mex food, the restaurant <v>Zuma</v> is also decent. It's on the lower level of the North Market Building.

There's a <v>McCormick and Schmick's</v> there that's good.

<v>Durgin Park</v> is an icon. Their Indian Pudding is legendary.

There is a good Italian restaurant right by the Common, <v>Teatro</v>. 

Another restaurant close to your hotel is <v>Erbaluce</v>.

<v>Erbaluce</v> is wonderful, regional, seasonal Italian! Only open for dinner. http://www.erbaluce-boston.com/index.html

<v>Teatro</v> is also good, been there forever & is consistent & typically bustling. Also only open for dinner. http://www.teatroboston.com/

Another nearby option is <v>Via Matta</v>, which is fun, modern & open for lunch & dinner during the week, dinner only on Saturday & closed on Sunday. www.viamattarestaurant.com/index_flash.htm

My favorite North End Italian is <v>Pomodoro</v>, which is a tiny hole in the wall place with no ambiance but great food. 

The <v>Hawthorne</v> at the Commonwealth Hotel is pretty well-know for their cocktails. 

You could have dinner at <v>Eastern Standard</v> or <v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v>.

I second the <v>Bristol Lounge</v> at the <v>Four Seasons Hotel</v>.

The <v>Bristol Lounge</v> is one that has been mentioned. 

The Bar at the <v>Taj Hotel</v> is nice, too, as well as <v>Oak Bar</v> at the Copley Plaza. 

A great place to have a drink is the Rooftop Bar at <v>Legal Harborside</v>, but sometimes it can be hard to get into. 

That reminds me of <v>Top of the Hub</v> on top of the Prudential Building (50 stories up).

but if you do down to <v>Legal Harborside</v>, you could also check out the <v>Atlantic Beer Garden</v> (same street). 

<v>Bristol Lounge</v> at the <v>Four Seasons</v>, Bar at the <v>Taj</v>, and <v>Oak Bar</v> at the Copley, are GREAT bars.

I would recommend getting a reservation at The <v>Hawthorne</v>. 

Or, if you are not looking for obscure cocktails, the <v>Bristol Lounge</v> is a great suggestion.

The <v>Bristol Lounge</v> is very old school <v>Four Seasons</v> bar. It's lovely, great service, expensive for sure but not very hip.

<v>Via Matta</v> www.viamattarestaurant.com/flash/movie.htm - fun & energetic

the <v>Oak Bar</v> http://oaklongbarkitchen.com/ - very old school & recently updated, classic cocktails

<v>Wink & Nod</v> http://www.winkandnod.com/ - lots of new buzz, but haven't been yet

<v>Franklin Cafe</v> http://www.franklincafe.com/ - always good & very neighborhoody

The <v>Beehive</v> http://www.beehiveboston.com/ - big, fun, live music

<v>Tavern Road</v> http://tavernroad.com/ - new & very good, hipstery

<v>Bond</v> http://www.bondboston.com/ - loungey & very fabulous

I also really enjoy the bars at <v>Nebo</v> http://neborestaurant.com/ & Trade http://trade-boston.com/

The suggestion of the <v>Hawthorne</v> is excellent, but not close to where you are staying.

Right in the Theater District is the <v>Emerald Lounge</v> in the <v>Revere Hotel</v>. 

I spent an evening at the <v>Emerald Lounge</v> in April for my birthday & it is mostly definitely a club!

I've never been to either so am probably no help, but from their websites <v>Post 390</v> looks a lot fancier and more expensive. 

I don't know <v>Harry's</v> but I definitely would not call <v>Post 390</v> pub like. 

Sorry, <v>Regina</v> is on Thatcher St., near Endicott.

Well, there's The <v>Daily Catch</v> on Hanover St., <v>Giacomo's</v> on Hanover St., 
<v>Cantina Italiana</v> on Hanover St., <v>Limoncello</v> on North St., and <v>Massimino's</v> on Endicott St. 

I second Matt's picks and for dessert <v>Mike's Pastry</v> will do.

<v>Modern Pastry</v> also just opened its expanded space next door. We should totally go.

I second <v>Modern Pastry</v>....I have always felt they are better hands down to <v>Mike's</v> or anyone else in the North End.

I think <v>Daily Catch</v>'s North End location is still cash only.

<v>Sarma</v> is excellent but way out of the way for you. 

<v>Oleana</v> is also very good. <v>Oleana's</v> chef also runs <v>Sarma</v>, I'm guessing you know that.

<v>Coppa</v> is one of my favorites and closer to your hotel.

<v>Craigie on Main</v> is much more expensive than the others, so keep that in mind.

<v>Sarma</v> and <v>Coppa</v> are probably best for grazing, with <v>Oleana</v> not far behind.

<v>Uni</v>, in your hotel, if you like sushi.

My mom was the one interested in <v>Craigie on Main</v>. 

From your feedback I think I might narrow it down to <v>Coppa</v> and <v>Samar</v>.

I think <v>Sarma</v> might be 11 minutes if there is no traffic at all, but at dinner time, I think it would take longer to get there. Maybe 20 minutes?

<v>Coppa</v> is fabulous. We were there most recently on Tuesday (the day after Jamie's win) & it was better than ever.

<v>Craigie on Main</v> is great - especially if you're down with nose-to-tail pork products. I haven't been in a couple years, but they get consistently great reviews & have a great brunch too.

I've not been to <v>Myers & Chang</v>, but it's been on my "to try" list for a while. Let us know how it is!

<v>Sportello</v> is another favorite of mine. 

<v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> isn't open at lunch but it is a great option for dinner, even if you'll have seafood when you're on the Cape.

And <v>Toro</v> is amazing...but no reservations. Awesome food, though!

<v>Coppa</v> is a favorite of mine and it is open from lunch on every day but Saturday. 

We love to stop into <v>Farm and Fable</v> across the street to see what's new in vintage cookbooks and wonderful old cooking and tableware. 

Then to <v>Formaggio</v> to pick up a cheese or two for supper. 

Next is always <v>Wholey Grain</v> for a very good version of Jordan Marsh Blueberry Muffins.

Might be biased because my buddy lives a 5 minute walk away, but <v>Santarpio's</v> in East Boston for pizza

my personal favorite places to eat are mostly in Chinatown. <v>Peach Farm</v> and the <v>Dumpling Cafe</v>, Inc.  Also, <v>Kaze</v> and <v>Shabu Zen</v> shabu shabu restaurants.

Also the <v>Marliave</v> in Downtown Crossing, Montien Thai restaurant on Stuart St., Vlora Mediterranean restaurant on Boylston St., Korean restaurants in Allston (Myeung Dong 1st avenue and Korea Garden are my favorites)

Take a walk on the Harborwalk, visit <v>Castle Island</v> in South Boston, have a Hot Dog at <v>Sullivan's</v>. 

If you go to Charlestown, make sure to grab a pint at the <v>Warren Tavern</v> (the food there's pretty decent too). 

We had heard of <v>Santarpios</v> and were going between that and <v>Regina</v> for pizza. 

The <v>Peabody-Essex Museum</v> has an outstanding collection of historic homes and maritime art (and more).

Italian Seafood ... <v>Daily Catch</v>. <v>Mare</v>.

<v>Legal Seafood</v> is a moderately priced local chain with reliably good quality seafood; 

I like both <v>Summer Shack</v> and <v>McCormicks</v>. Their happy hour is a great deal (food only). 

You mention the <v>Parish Cafe</v>. It's famous for having several Boston chefs contribute sandwiches and light dishes to the menu.

I'd add <v>Salty Dog</v> at <v>Faneuil Hall</v> and <v>James Hook</v>.

Might not be the exact place you are speaking of but I understand there is a Irish Pub in our hotel, the <v>Lenox</v>.

Since you will be in Wellesley, you should try Ming Tsai's restaurant <v>Blue Ginger</v>, http://www.ming.com/blue-ginger.htm

The <v>Museum of Fine Arts in Boston</v> is open until 9:45, Weds, Thurs, Friday 

and the <v>Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</v> (also in Boston) is open on Thursdays until 9:00. 

Regarding <v>Amaluna</v>, I haven't been but there's some reviews on TA and on yelp that might be of use.

Seafood with a view (on water): <v>Legal Harborside</v> -- first floor casual, 2nd floor fine dining, 3rd floor rooftop bar.

Steak with a view (on water): <v>DelFrisco's</v>

Seafood without a view: <v>Island Creek Oyster House</v>, <v>Atlantic Fish</v>

<v>Top of The Hub</v> at the <v>Prudential Center</v> has beautiful views (50 stories high). You pay extra for the view, but the food is good.

Steak without a view: Boston has just about all of the typical steak house chains. Locally-owned steak places include <v>Grill 23</v>, and <v>Abe & Louis</v>

Italian Seafood: <v>Mare</v> or <v>Daily Catch</v>

<v>Children's museum</v> is free after 5pm on Fridays, gets more crowded but would save money since you mention a budget. 

The <v>Big Apple Circus</v> is in town on City Hall Plaza (right near Quincy Market) 

Nice View = <v>Top of The Hub</v>

Other venues with nice view - the new <v>Legal Seafood</v> Harborside.

<v>Top of the Hub</v> relies on it's view - the food is terrible. Fine for a drink though!

<v>No. 9 Park</v> is great food, pretty upscale with a lovely view of Boston Common.

<v>Bistro du Midi</v> also has great food, slightly more casual & a gorgeous view of Boston Garden.

<v>Sam's at Louis Boston</v> in the Seaport is nice & weather permitting you can eat on the deck. Nice food as well.

Both <v>Trade</v> & <v>Nebo</v> look out onto the Financial District & the Greenway park. Good food at both.

<v>Joe's Bar & Grill</v> or <v>Tia's</v> near Long Wharf offer a nice view, casual eating, decent food & outdoor seating if the weather is nice.

I'm not really a <v>Legal Seafoods</v> fan, personally but the Harborside location has a nice view.

I would not call <v>Tia's</v> on the Waterfomt a "special occasion restaurant."

I enjoy the food at the <v>Top of The Hub</v>. I prefer to sit in their lounge with their live Jazz music. It can be a romantic place.

I agree, <c>Top of the Hub</v> for drinks or <v>Tia's</v> for drinks (only if it is a nice night and you can sit outdoors).

also, the roof deck at the <v>Legal Seafood</v> has decent sushi and nice harbor views, good for lunch or dinner on a warm day. 

<v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> has very good seafood but no view.

<v>Capital Grill</v> or <v>Grill 23</v> have good steak.

some place with nice outdoor seating? For that I like <v>Oleana's</v> but it's in Cambridge. 

<v>Blu</v> has a decent view from what I remember - also been a while!

I second the rec for <v>Del Frisco's</v>. I went there for a blogger event, and the food was really good. 

It's a chain, but there is a <v>Del Frisco</v> steak house on the water right by <v>Legal</v>.

You want "over-the-top" special occasion look at <v>Menton</v> or <v>L'Espalier</v>. 

Another very nice restaurant is <v>Mamma Maria</v> in the North End. 

Going to a Red Sox baseball game at <v>Fenway Park</v> this week!

We are dining at the <v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> next Friday, April 18. 

After dinner we have tickets at <v>Fenway</v> to see the Red Sox.

<v>Ricardo's</v> and <v>genaro's</v> 5 North Square might work. 

My first thought is <v>Ricardo's</v> too.

There are a lot of restaurants that would work. Also consider <v>Antico Forno</v>.

<v>LoConte</v> is on Salem street and very casual. 

We ate at a restaurant called "<v>Mare</v>" and <v>Neptune Oyster</v>...yum!!

I'd check out <v>Mama Maria</v> first, not so casual but relaxing.

I like <v>Mare</v>...but my favorites are <v>L'Osteria</v> and <v>Pagliuca's</v>, both pretty casual and both with a more traditional North End atmosphere than <v>Mare</v>.

Very casual with good variety: <v>Riccardo's</v>: http://riccardosnorthend.com

also ... Classic and historic: <v>Cantina Italiana</v>. Http://www.cantinaitaliana.com

I also really like <v>La Summa</v> on Fleet St. 

and <v>Massimino's</v> on Endicott St.

I think all the recommendations so far are solid with <v>Massimino's</v> and <v>Ricardo's</v> being my favorite amoung them.

<v>Al Dente</v> on Salem. Small, excellent Italian, friendly service. 

I love <v>Cafe Fiore</v> --- 250 Hanover Street. Great food, reasonable prices, beautiful atmosphere.

Years and years ago, when I worked in politics, Ted Kennedy swore by <v>Sareceno</v>. Haven't been to it in years but remember it well. Its also on Hanover.

Regardless of what you do, stop by <v>Mike's</v> for dessert :) The line is so worth it!

I was looking at <v>Legal Seafood</v> at Park Square since it is close to the common.

You can get a great meal across Huntington Avenue at <v>Brasserie Jo</v> in the <v>Colonnade Hotel</v>.

If you cut straight across to Massachusetts Avenue you might enjoy the Thai and Vietnamese food at <v>Pho Basil</v>

my favorite pizza and pub grub is at <v>Woody's</v> another block beyond Mass Ave. 

<v>Braserie Jo</v> is always our "go-to" for dinner before the symphony.

I was also going to suggest <v>Brasserie Jo</v> and <v>Pho Basil</v>. 

As for other places to eat: I enjoy the <v>Bangkok House</v> on Mass Ave.

I have also been to <v>Brasserie Jo</v>, which is also nice...

<v>Pizzeria Regina</v> in the North End is "MUST" in my book.

<v>Cannoli</v> in the north end. 

My favorite north end restaurant is <v>Maria's</v> but they aren't opened as late as <v>Modern</v> and <v>Mike's</v>. 

<v>Bova's</v> is opened all 24/7.

I also love the Monkfish Marsala and Swordfish vinaigrette at the <v>Daily Catch</v> (northern ave and hanover street )

I don't love most of the food court options at <v>Faneuil Hall</v>, but do really enjoy <v>Wagamama</v> for Japanese noodles.

Lobster Roll and fries at <v>Neptune Oyster</v>!

If you want Fried Clams, try <v>Fisherman's Net</v> at Quincy Market 

Haven't been, but there's a new restaurant called <v>Ginger Exchange</v>.

One of my favorite choices near Symphony is <v>Lucy Ethiopian Cafe</v>. It's very good. If you go, make sure to get the peanut tea.

FYI, both <v>Toro</v> and <v>Orinoco</v> are notorious for having long lines to get in. 

Especially at <v>Toro</v>, there can be a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night.

We walked into <v>Orinoco</v> at 6:15 and were the second table seated for the evening.

Folks do enjoy the clam chowder although <v>Durgin Park</v> is not the place that came to mind to get it.

The <v>Pizzeria Regina</v> at Quincy Market is not as good

You might go to <v>Pizzeria Regina</v> in the north end, for the excellent pizza

I concur regarding the <v>Union Oyster House</v>- established in 1826- great place for a lobster roll!

There's a <v>Legal Seafoods</v> in Park Square not far from you

For higher end Northern Italian there are <v>Prezza</v> and <v>Mamma Maria</v>.

For red sauce Italian-American I like <v>Cantina Italiana</v>. 

<v>Atlantic Fish</v> or <v>Legal's Seafoods</v>

Consider <v>La Voile</v>, Newbury St., <v>Brasserie Jo</v>, Huntington Ave., <v>Lala Rohk</v>, Mt. Vernon St. (Persian food).

Here are recent check ins: <v>El centro</v>, <v>one Caroline street bistro</v>, <v>mistral</v>, <v>blue dragon</v>, <v>legal seafood by waterfront</v>

Here's some of my favorites: <v>Legal Seafoods</v> Long Wharf, <v>Hillstone</v>, <v>North 26</v>, <v>Smith & Wollensky</v>

Steakhouse: <v>Abe and Louis</v>

Seafood: <v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v>

Mexican: <v>Lolita Cocina</v>

<v>Brasserie Jo's</v> is uneven, so I would not keep it on your list. 

I hear that <v>Island Creek</v> is great. 

<v>Gaslight</v> is highly praised. 

If you felt like going to Harvard Square, I really like <v>Harvest</v>.

I really like the <v>Summer Shack</v> on Dalton street. 

There's <v>Mike's Pastry</v> and <v>Modern</v>. Big debate over which one is better. 

For breakfast, I'd go to <v>Thortons</v>. It's on Huntington Ave I believe

<v>Summer Shack </v>may be a good option, since they are in a good and accessible location.

<v>Legal Seafoods</v> - I like the Long Wharf restaurant. 

For dessert, pastry options in North End - <v>Mike's</v> is my favourite. For full dessert menu choice

Also <v>Finale</v> at Park Plaza (and at Harvard) 

or <v>Max Brenner</v> for chocolate desserts

If chocolate is your thing, try <v>Burdick's</v> on Brattle St, Harvard (only a 5 minute walk from Harvard Square T station.)

Take a look at <v>Grill 23</v>. It's a local favorite and a very nice steakhouse.

Steak Houses worth your time: <v>Abe and Louie's</v>, <v>Ruth's Chris</v> (this is a chain, but still good)

<v>Top of the Hub</v> - This is a restaurant on the top of the <v>Prudential Center</v>. Great views and great food. Has something for everyone.

For the wow factor, I like <v>Sorellina</v>. Modern Italian, meat on the menu, and an attractive, spacious room.

If you want a steak house with a wow factor, try <v>Del Friscos</v>. It has great views of the harbor.

Have you ever been to the <v>Peabody Essex Museum</v> in Salem? 

Have you been to Harvard's <v>Museum of Natural History</v>? The glass flowers are amazing.

There is an excellent exhibit at the <v>Peabody Essex Museum</v> on mid-century modern California design 1930-1965.

So <v>Mr Bartley's</v> burger bar in Harvard Square at 9:00?

Maybe <v>Antico Forno</v> or <v>Rabia's</v> (or <v>Pizzeria Regina</v> for pizza). 

Try <v>Smith & Wollensky</v> or <v>Abe & Louie's</v> for steak.

BURGERS: <v>Mr. Bartley's</v>. (Cambridge) If you go get the raspberry lime rickey. 

Or <v>R. F. O'Sullivan</v> (Somerville). Delicious

STEAK: Many chains to pick from <v>Flemmings</v>, <v>Mortons</v>, <v>Abe and Louis</v>

Cambridge/Somerville has <v>Club Passim</v>, <v>Johnny D's</v>, and the <v>Middle Eastern</v>.

For the red sauce Italian-American you're looking for a place I like is <v>Cantina Italiana</v>. 

For a chain with a unique location (water view) there is <v>Del Frisco's</v>.

The oldest Mexican restaurant in town is <v>Casa Romero</v>.  it's tucked in an alley in the Back Bay and is very cozy, even has a terrace.

Mexican: My favorite Mexican place is <v>Anna's Taqueria</v>. 

Within a close walk from the <v>Omni Parker House</v>, check out <v>JM Curley's</v>, <v>Stoddards</v> (my favorite), and the <v>Kinsale</v>. All fantastic bars with great beer selections!

Check out <v>Island Creek Oysters</v> or <v>Citizen Public House</v>.

In addition to our burgers at <v>Mr Bartley's</v>, the Mr and I enjoyed a burger at the <v>Warren Tavern</v> in Charlestown.

Since you are staying at the <v>Omni Parker House</v> you must have a slice of their amazing Boston Cream pie in <v>Parker's</v>.. Yum-O!

If you like Thai food, <v>Montien</v> on Stuart St. is close and is an excellent restaurant.

Gonna go to the <v>Flick Theater</v> in Lexington on a date. 

You could also go see the <v>West End gym</v> in Lowell where much of the Fighter was filmed. It's pretty cool.

<v>Kings</v> is in the Back Bay and has a sort of "clam shack" style restaurant next door- <v>Summer Shack</v>. 

ten pin bowling is available in the center of the city. <v>Kings</v> is in the Back Bay.

You should also try Skee Ball if you go to <v>Kings</v> - very traditional New England game.

You can take the T to Davis square Somerville for Candlepin Bowling at <v>Sacco's Bowl Haven</v>.

Another place you could go would be <v>Bella Luna</v> in Jamaica Plain. It's a restaurant with a bowling alley downstairs.

While in JP you could also go to the <v>Sam Adams brewery</v> for a tour and some free beer.

<v>Grafton Street pub</v> in Harvard Square Cambridge

I thought that <v>Bella Luna</v> had moved or closed so I'm glad it's still operating with bowling.

They closed 2 years ago but have relocated to another spot in JP closer to the <v>Sam Adams Brewery</v>

there's still a night clubby type place (<v>Milky Way lounge</v>) attached that has some comfy seating

Penny ... I haven't been to <v>Sacco's</v> since the pizza folks moved in ...

If you go to the <v>Sam Adams brewery</v>, go to <v>Doyle's</v> afterwards. It's an old Boston bar with a lot of character.

Plenty of bars around Fenway, all will have a good crowd and atmosphere on game day. <v>Jerry Remys</v> and <v>Cask n Flagon</v> are a couple I've been to repeatedly.

<v>Castle Island</v> (<v>Fort Independence</v>) in South Boston - There's a small burger/hot dog type stand called <v>Sullivan's</v> there

The Mapparium at the <v>Mary Baker Eddy Library</v> is kind of a weird but I think cool and unusual place to see.

For movies, if you want to see any while you're here, there's a big <v>Loews theater</v> across from the <v>Boston Common</v> that does all the major releases. 

The <v>Landmark Kendall Square theater</v> in Cambridge is a good one that shows independent, documentery and those type films that aren't as widely released. 

There's another bowling place in Southie - <v>South Boston Candlepin</v> - on East Broadway but I haven't been there.

Take the Blue Line out to Wonderland, and get a roast beef sandwich at <v>Kelly's</v>. 

And there's plenty of Candlepin bowling available in Boston. You can go to the <v>Dorchester Bowl</v> on Morrissey Boulevard. 

<v>Sam Adams brewery</v> with the side trip to Doyle's is pretty touristy 

but not as touristy as the <v>Cheers bar</v>, which is a place no local would be caught dead in.

Incidentally, I think going to a game at <v>Fenway</v> is pretty touristy these days.

It's a building on the corner of Farnsworth and Congress st., across from the <v>Boston Fire Museum</v>.

one of the finest "dive bars" in Boston is across the street, on the corner of A St. and Congress. It's called <v>Lucky's</v>. 

For the Sox, there are tons of bars in the area- <v>Cask and Flagon</v> would be a good one to go to amongst many.

Agree with above about <v>Sacco's Bowl Haven</v> in Davis (the Flatbread Pizza restuarant was a good addition to it)

also there is a candlepin bowling alley in </v>Ball Square Somerville</v>.

I recommend the <v>USS Constitution</v> in Charlestown, and the <v>Paul Revere House</v>. 

Boston has some amazing art museums - like the <v>Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</v>.

I recommend drinks at the <v>Top of the Hub</v> for the view (it's at the <v>Prudential Center</v>).

Newton Highlands has a nice neighborhood bar: <v>O'Hara's</v>. 

Also, <v>Terry O'Reilly's</v> in Newton Centre is nice. 

a friend who lives in da 'ville goes to <v>Saccos</v> a couple times a year and likes the pizza there.

Not that I turn away from Davis since I don't live in Somerville: <v>Redbones</v>, <v>Boston Burger</v>, <v>Posto</v>,
<v>Burren</v>, <v>Sligo</v>, <v>Gargoyles</v> when it was there, <v>Saloon</v>, <v>Foundry</v>... been to them all.

I've been to <v>Johnny D's</v> and <v>Joshua Tree</v> too

I just haven't made it to <v>Saccos</v> yet.

I think the exterior of the "Harvard bar" in Good Will Hunting was the <v>Bow & Arrow</v> 

If you do go to Davis Square and are looking for dive bars, check out <v>Sligo</v>.

Think <v>Doyle's cafe</v> opened in 1882 in Jamaica Plain.

<v>Doyle's</v> is an Institution in JP and I recommend a visit.

Cannot wait to experience 'game day' at <v>Fenway Park</v>.

<v>Legal</v> is famous for chowder.

<v>Durgin Park</v> is NOT famous for steak. It is famous for it's comical service (often rude) and old fashioned food.

Breakfast: Walk across the <v>Boston Common</v> to the Paramount.

Breakfast... there are <v>dunkin donuts</v> everywhere!!! 

However, <v>Union Oyster House</v> which is right in the same area is worth a visit

<v>Durgin Park</v> used to be know for its Prime Rib (not steak). Haven't been there recently.

I would also recommend an evening meal at the <v>Top Of The Hub</v>. Great views of the city.

You can also use your tourist link pass for the Inner Habor Ferry to Charlestown to see the <v>USS Constitution</v>.

<v>Dunkin Donuts</v> will be open early, no worries there.

there are plenty of steak houses including around Back Bay. 
For example, the <v>Capital Grille</v>, <v>Smith & Wollensky</v>, <v>Abe and Louis</v>, <v>Grill 23</v>, <v>Morton's</v>.

I like <v>Abe and Louis</v> and <v>Capital Grille</v>.

We'll drive to Foxboro to visit <v>Gillette Stadium</v> as well as the <v>Hall</v>. 

Take a look at <v>Grill 23</v>. It's a local favorite and a very nice steakhouse.

An Italian Sausage with peppers or a Fenway Frank are my favorite ball time eats at <v>Fenway</v>!

When we go to <v>Fenway</v> for the game, should we eat inside the park or should we eat something before we go in?

What is the "must eat" item at/around <v>Fenway</v>?

There are plenty of vendors both inside and out of <v>Fenway</v>. 

<v>Margiannos Little Italy</v> (i think i spelt that right...) Good italian food for a great price 

Also across the street from <v>Blue Man group</v> is <v>California Pizza Kitchen</v>

The one night we are there we are planning on going to see the <v>Blue Man Group</v>, any suggestions for a good dinner in that area?

<v>Fire and Ice</v> - amazing stir fry - you get your bowl and put in all the items you want

I bet if you ask the bartenders at blue man they'll have some good suggestions.

I would agree with <v>Maggiano's</v>. 

Also <v>P.F. Chang's</v> is excellent.

ideas: <v>Legal Seafoods</v>, <v>M. J. O'Connor's</v>, <v>Penang</v> (Malaysian restaurant, on Washington St just north of the Kneeland/Stuart intersection), 
<v>Jacob Wirth's</v>, Todd English's <v>Bonfire</v>, <v>Davio's</v>...

<v>Fig's</v> - A Todd English Restaurant

<v>Jae'sv (Asian/Fusion) is right around the corner

In the other direction, The <v>Barking Crab</v> is a great place for seafood

Any of the restaurants in the South End are close, but not really the most scenic of walks...
<v>Hammersley's Bistro</v>, <V>Aquaitaine</v>, <v>B & G Oysters</v>, <v>Franklin Cafe</v>, <v>647 Tremont</v>, <v>Grille 23</v>

When we go to the Theater we eat at <v>Troquet</v>

My other go to in the area is <v>PF Changs</v> if you don't already have one near you at home

There are two Todd English restaurants that are at <v>Fauneuil Hall</v> and both pretty good -- <v>King Fish</v> and <v>Rustica Kitchen</v>

<v>King Fish</v> is a bit more formal with great fish 

and <v>Rustica Kitchen</v> is more informal with more Italian inspired dishes (lots of polenta and pasta). 

Other options are <v>Plaza III</v>, which is a pretty typical but good steak restaurant

or <v>Houston's</v> which has good food and it casual and fun

Another favorite in this area is <v>Sel de la Terre</v>

<v>Temptations cafe</v> on Huntington. Call before going.

There is also <v>Au bon pain</v> both in the Pru and in Copley Place.

The <v>Midtown</v> is almost right across the street from the <v>Prudential Center</v>. 

there's a <v>Panera Bread</v> at the corner of Gainsborough Street

The <v>Beehive</v> has live music every night.

We had lunch at <v>Lucky's Lounge</v> recently and it was fantastic.

I love <v>Kinsale</v> in Government Center! 

Arriving No Station via Amtrak & heading to <v>Science Museum</v> on Sat.

You could make it easier on yourself and just take the Green Line two stops to the <v>Museum of Science</v> stop.

We had a lovely meal in the <v>Franklin Cafe</v> earlier this month - just a short cab ride from Back Bay area.

Also enjoyed <v>L'espalier</v> if you really want to push the boat out good food and service.

One of my favorite restaurants in the city is <v>Toro</v>

If you are in the South End, for lunch or a late night snack, <v>Francesca's</v> is pretty good.

Must Eat RW (although some may be booked up). <v>Mistral</v>, <v>Sorellina</v>, <v>Bina Encontina</v>, <v>Scampo</v>, <v>Beacon Hill Bistro</v>, <v>Oceanaire</v>, <v>Oishii</v>.

Aside from the fantastic food and local atmosphere of <v>Franklin Cafe</v>, they, too, are open late for dinner. 

If you like sea food I recommend <v>King Fish Hall</v>. You'll be delighted.

I've only been to <v>Casa Romero</v> once before

We really like a Persian restaurant called <v>Lala Rokh</v>. It is located in the heart of Boston - Beacon Hill area.

If you're looking in Back Bay, and wanting something a little different, I like <v>Bomboa</v> - Brazilian cuisine, Really good

A couple of suggestions: the <v>Parish Cafe</v> on Boylston St., <v>Stephanies</v> on Newbury St., and <v>Joe's American Bar</v> on Newbury. All are casual and you can order from any part of the menu.

If you wanted just chowder and maybe crab cakes, you could try <v>Legal Seafood</v> in the Prudential, or, even closer, in Copley Place.

If you are looking for really good sandwich, salad or soup, you might want to try <v>Flour Bakery</v> on Clarendon Street.

The <v>Salty Pig</v> is right next to your hotel and it is wonderful. You can get great wood fired pizzas, or you can make up your own platters of cured meats and cheese

The <v>Salty Pig</v> is awesome!

<v>Stephanies</v> on Newbury street has more of a following from those outside USA.

On a side note: <v>legals</v> in havard square is having dollar oysters today from 2-4.

<v>sweet green</v> on boylston street is a nice salad place.

I also second <v>Flour</v>. <v>Flour</v> has delicious sandwiches and you should try their sticky buns! the best ever!

Yes, <v>Flour</v> is awesome - definitely worth checking out! 

And so it the <v>Salty Pig</v> (their food is great, and so is their beer selection!)

For good clam chowder, <v>Turner Fisheries</v> at the <v>Westin Copley hotel</v>, or <v>Legal Seafoods</v> (any location).

If you are flat out against a chain place, you could also try <v>Mooo</v> at the <v>XV Beacon hotel</v>. It's more expensive, but the food is very good.

My favorite steak house in Boston right now is <v>Flemings Prime</v>, in Park Square. 

Consider <v>Ruth's Chris</v>

For North End, if you want more Italian-American style, then <v>La Summa</v> and <v>Massimino's</v> are both excellent

For a more elegant experience, <v>Mamma Maria</v> is wonderful. 

If you love pasta, and don't mind waiting in a line and paying cash, <v>Giacomo's</v> is very very good as well.

If you want Italian seafood, the <v>Daily Catch</v> on Hanover St. is great. 

<v>Abe and Louie's</v> is fine, but very loud. Oak Room has better atmosphere as do <v>Capital Grille</v> and <v>Grille 23</v>, as well as <v>Mooo</v> and <v>KO Prime</v>.

No contest -- best chowder anywhere is at any <v>Legal Seafoods</v> (not the biggest fan of the rest of their food though).

Yes, there's a <v>Legal Seafoods</v> in Copley Place and another at the <v>Prudential Center</v>, so you can walk to two of them in the rain and never wet your feet.

I like the atmosphere at the <v>Oak Room</v> (it has kind of an Old World charm), 

more so than that at <v>Abe and Louies</v> anyway (which feels to me, like most steakhouses in town, kind of corporate and generic and while certainly expensive, not very special).

<v>Prezza</v> in the North End is great for steak (among other things).

You may also consider some Northern Italian restaurants in the North End, such as <v>Prezza</v> that specialize in steak.

What about <v>Abe and Louies</v>? Anywhere else?

but the <v>Oak Room</v> is a better overall dining experience than <v>Abe & Louie's</v>, and most other steakhouses.

That also brings to mind <v>Davio's</v> in Park Square. I believe they bill themselves as an Italian steak house.

<v>Smith and Wollensky</v>!!!! http://www.smithandwollensky.com/

I recommend the North End as well, I would probably eat at <v>Mamma Maria</v> which is just off of Hanover Street.

For Seafood try <v>Legal Seafood</v> near the <v>Aquarium</v>.

For Chinese Food I would try PF Changs in the <v>Theater District</v>

also in the Back Bay at the <v>Prudential Center</v>, too

<v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> for seafood, but make reservations on game days.

I recommend <v>Tasty Burger</v>. 

<v>Easter Standard</v> is one of my favorites but like others have said, make a reservation and check out the menu beforehand.

The food inside <v>Fenway</v> is meh

There are tons of good places in the <v>fenway</v> area now. My favorites are <v>Tasty Burger</v>, <v>Citizens Pub</v>, <v>Basho</v> and <v>La Verdad</v>.

I also recommend <v>Eastern Standard</v>. Make a reservation now. Don't wait.

<v>Eastern Standard</v> is wonderful. Expensive, but worth it. Yes, make reservations if you hope to get a seat there.

We are having problems where to eat dinner 4th July. We were going to the <v>Hyatt Regency</v>, but had to cancel

The <v>Hyatt</v> would have one of the best views of the fireworks.
