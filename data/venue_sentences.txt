How about <v>Jacob Wirth</v> on Stuart Street: http://www.jacobwirth.com/menus/dinner

Mexican: <v>Lolita Cocina</v>

Constitution Yacht Club invites members and friends to the Club's Annual Awards and Brunch, Sunday, November 10th, at <v>Joe's American Bar and Grill</v> on the Waterfront. 

Some Japanese options: <v>O Ya</v>, <v>Uni</v>, <v>Umai</v>, and <v>Oishii</v>.

I had a pretty nice meal at <v>Firebrand Saints</v>, and also at <v>Za</v>.

you can also try <v>Antico Forno</v> on Salem St

In addition to <v>La Summa</v> in the <v>North End</v>, which is excellent, 

How about <v>1369</v> or <v>Life Alive</v>?

my favorite place on Salem St is <v>Neptune</v>

my personal favorite places to eat are mostly in <v>Chinatown</v>. <v>Peach Farm</v> and the <v>Dumpling Cafe</v>, Inc.  Also, <v>Kaze</v> and <v>Shabu Zen</v> shabu shabu restaurants.

Go to the <v>Marliave</v>. They have a lovely outdoor patio, or if that's filled, the first floor inside is really nice, with a tin ceiling, and a giant antique bar. 

In the <v>North End</v>, try <v>La Summa</v>, <v>Cantina Italiana</v>, <v>Massimino's</v> or <v>Pizzeria Regina</v>.

<v>Chinatown</v> is my favorite place to eat in <v>Boston</v>: <v>Peach Farm</v>, <v>Gourmet Dumpling House</v>, <v>New Shanghai</v>, <v>Asian Garden</v>, <v>Best Little Restaurant</v>, <v>Great Taste restaurant</v>, <v>Xinh Xinh</v> and <v>Pho Pasteur</v> (both for Vietnamese and wonderful Pho), <v>Shabu Shabu at Q</v> restaurant, or <v>Kaze</v>.

but the <v>Oak Room</v> is a better overall dining experience than <v>Abe & Louie's</v>, and most other steakhouses.

That also brings to mind <v>Davio's</v> in <v>Park Square</v>. I believe they bill themselves as an Italian steak house.

<v>Eastern Standard</v> is wonderful. Expensive, but worth it. Yes, make reservations if you hope to get a seat there.

There are tons of good places in the <v>fenway</v> area now. My favorites are <v>Tasty Burger</v>, <v>Citizens Pub</v>, <v>Basho</v> and <v>La Verdad</v>.

<v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> isn't open at lunch but it is a great option for dinner, even if you'll have seafood when you're on the Cape.

Go to <v>Neptune</v> and get a lobster roll.

there are plenty of steak houses including around Back Bay. 
For example, the <v>Capital Grille</v>, <v>Smith & Wollensky</v>, <v>Abe and Louies</v>, <v>Grill 23</v>, <v>Morton's</v>.

I would also recommend an evening meal at the <v>Top Of The Hub</v>. Great views of the city.

Options: <v>Row 34</v>, <v>Blue Ginger</v>, <v>Bee's Knee's</v>, <v>Flour</v>

Not that I turn away from <v>Davis</v> since I don't live in <v>Somerville</v>: <v>Redbones</v>, <v>Boston Burger</v>, <v>Posto</v>,
<v>Burren</v>, <v>Sligo</v>, <v>Gargoyles</v> when it was there, <v>Saloon</v>, <v>Foundry</v>... been to them all.

Check out <v>Island Creek Oysters</v> or <v>Citizen Public House</v>.

DATE: Thursday, June 14th - REGISTER TODAY!
TIME: 6:00-8:00PM
LOCATION:
<v>Scholars</v> American Bistro and Cocktail Lounge

For dessert, pastry options in <v>North End</v> - <v>Mike's</v> is my favourite. For full dessert menu choice

Steak Houses worth your time: <v>Abe and Louie's</v>, <v>Ruth's Chris</v> (this is a chain, but still good)

Meal in the <v>North End</v> capped off with a dessert from <v>Mikes</v> or <v>Modern Pastry</v>.

One of my favorite restaurants in the city is <v>Toro</v>

There are tons of good places in the <v>fenway</v> area now. My favorites are <v>Tasty Burger</v>, <v>Citizen Pub</v>, <v>Basho</v> and <v>La Verdad</v>.

<v>Bartley's</v> does not take reservations. 

<v>Stephanies</v> on Newbury street has more of a following from those outside USA.

<v>Regina's</v> in the <v>North End</v>

<v>Pizzeria Regina</v> in the <v>North End</v> is "MUST" in my book.

I like Pizzaria <v>Regina</v> on Thatcher Street in the <v>North End</v>.

<v>Atlantic Fish</v> is not the place to go if you have a fish allergy! 

For casual - <v>Yankee Lobster</v> or <v>James Hook</v> are two good choices.

If you want you can check out <v>Henrietta's Table</v> at the <v>Charles Hotel</v>

Maybe <v>Antico Forno</v> or <v>Rabia's</v> (or <v>Pizzeria Regina</v> for pizza). 

STEAK: Many chains to pick from <v>Flemmings</v>, <v>Mortons</v>, <v>Abe and Louies</v>

Seafood without a view: <v>Island Creek Oyster House</v>, <v>Atlantic Fish</v>

<v>Top of The Hub</v> at the <v>Prudential Center</v> has beautiful views (50 stories high). You pay extra for the view, but the food is good.

<v>Uni</v>, in your hotel, if you like sushi.

We had lunch at <v>Lucky's Lounge</v> recently and it was fantastic.

<v>Franklin Cafe</v> http://www.franklincafe.com/ - always good & very neighborhoody

<v>Sarma</v> and <v>Coppa</v> are probably best for grazing, with <v>Oleana</v> not far behind.

the <v>Oak Bar</v> http://oaklongbarkitchen.com/ - very old school & recently updated, classic cocktails

Steak with a view (on water): <v>Del Frisco's</v>

Within a close walk from the <v>Omni Parker House</v>, check out <v>JM Curley's</v>, <v>Stoddards</v> (my favorite), and the <v>Kinsale</v>. All fantastic bars with great beer selections!

<v>Via Matta</v> www.viamattarestaurant.com/flash/movie.htm - fun & energetic

You want "over-the-top" special occasion look at <v>Menton</v> or <v>L'Espalier</v>. 

Agree with above about <v>Sacco's Bowl Haven</v> in <v>Davis</v> (the Flatbread Pizza restuarant was a good addition to it)

Since you're staying at the Westin, the <v>Legal Sea foods</v> at Copley Place is probably going to be closest

We can try getting into <v>Bondir</v>, its in <v>Cambridge</v> too

Might not be the exact place you are speaking of but I understand there is a Irish Pub in our hotel, the <v>Lenox</v>.

Overall, <v>Giacomo's</v> Ristorante is a solid Italian restaurant. 

<v>No. 9 Park</v> is great food, pretty upscale with a lovely view of Boston Common.

THE CLUB S TICKET OFFICE AT <v>FENWAY PARK</v> FOR A REFUND OF THE FACE VALUE OF THE TICKET ONLY. 

We will probably go to <v>east ocean</v> or <v>gourmet dumpling</v>.

Roisin and I have been looking up menus and we've narrowed it down to two choices. 
<v>Elephant Walk</v> (on Mass Ave w/ parking)  http://www.elephantwalk.com/cambridge/menus/Cambridge_Dinner_Menu_20100808.pdf 
or <v>Sabur</v> (in <v>Teele square</v>) http://www.saburrestaurant.com/menu/dinner.pdf

Kate are you thinking of the <v>Landing at Long Wharf</v>? It's part of Boston Harbor Cruises.

<v>Atlantic Fish</v> or <v>Legal's Seafoods</v>

Kayla wants to try to go to <v>little India</v> for dinner

<v>Craigie on Main</v> is great - especially if you're down with nose-to-tail pork products. I haven't been in a couple years, but they get consistently great reviews & have a great brunch too.

Have you been to <v>Row 34</v>?

I think <v>Daily Catch</v>'s North End location is still cash only.

try <v>Kaze Shabu-Shabu</v> restaurant on Harrison Ave. at Essex St. 

We could do a hot yoga class at <v>prana</v>?

<v>Moksa</v> is not one of my favorite places.

There are plenty of vendors both inside and out of <v>Fenway</v>. 

Any chance you can meet somewhere downtown instead of Kendall, say <v>Petit Robert Central</v> (same building as the downtown crossing T) or <v>Trade</v> (nearby to <v>South Station</v>)?

<v>Bistro du Midi</v> is in the <v>Heritage</v> on the Garden Building on the next block.

What is the "must eat" item at/around <v>Fenway</v>?

Breakfast -- <v>In a Pickle</v> -- 9:00 am -- Monday

There is a good Italian restaurant right by the Common, <v>Teatro</v>. 

Lobster Roll and fries at <v>Neptune Oyster</v>!

And for 'pan pizza', <v>Galleria Umberto</v>, Hanover Street, North End. 

<v>Eastern Standard</v> rocks - this place is also very good:

One of my favorite choices near Symphony is <v>Lucy Ethiopian Cafe</v>. It's very good. If you go, make sure to get the peanut tea.

Haven't been, but there's a new restaurant called <v>Ginger Exchange</v>.

ideas: <v>Legal Sea foods</v>, <v>M. J. O'Connor's</v>, <v>Penang</v> (Malaysian restaurant, on Washington St just north of the Kneeland/Stuart intersection), 
<v>Jacob Wirth's</v>, Todd English's <v>Bonfire</v>, <v>Davio's</v>...

Since you will be in <v>Wellesley</v>, you should try Ming Tsai's restaurant <v>Blue Ginger</v>, http://www.ming.com/blue-ginger.htm

STEAK: Many chains to pick from <v>Flemings</v>, <v>Mortons</v>, <v>Abe and Louies</v>

<v>Castle Island</v> (<v>Fort Independence</v>) in <v>South Boston</v> - There's a small burger/hot dog type stand called <v>Sullivan's</v> there

And <v>Life Alive</v> or <v>1369</v> would be perfect.

BURGERS: <v>Mr. Bartley's</v>. (Cambridge) If you go get the raspberry lime rickey. 

I realize we never confirmed on timing for tonight at <v>Trina's</v>.

Here's some of my favorites: <v>Legal Sea foods</v> Long Wharf, <v>Hillstone</v>, <v>North 26</v>, <v>Smith & Wollensky</v>

There's an <v>Annas</v> on the Mit campus...

<v>Modern pastry</v> the next day good call, or MUCH better go to <v>Bova Bakery</v>

<v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> is a classy restaurant by all means and has a great variety to back it up. 

Italian Seafood ... <v>Daily Catch</v>. <v>Mare</v>.

If you go to Charlestown, make sure to grab a pint at the <v>Warren Tavern</v> (the food there's pretty decent too). 

<v>Atlantic Fish</v> on Boylston Street

Come share the day with us at <v>Sunday River</v> on T2 serviced by the Locke Mountain Triple starting at 9am and last download at 3:30.

Some suggestions in the area: 
<v>Blue Dragon</v>, <v>Toro</v>, <v>Estragon</v> (both Tapas places), 
<v>Tapeo</v>, <v>Cuchi Cuchi</v> (loads of fun, great drinks), 
<v>Puritan and Co</v>, <v>Piattini</v>, <v>Sarma</v> (Turkish mezze...excellent, highly recommend).

delicious food from <v>Dave's Fresh Pasta</v>, <v>Diva Indian Bistro</v> and <v>Oasis Brazilian Restaurant</v> at no charge to you.

07/23 - <v>Blue Shirt Cafe</v> - Restaurants: $14.87

Man, it's been a while since I built an <v>Annas</v> dinner...  Can I get a super burrito with cheese, chicken, rice, lettuce and onion?  No beans please.

It feels as though we've largely exhausted the restaurants in the immediate area, so we're going to nearby <v>Newton</v> for dinner.  The restaurant is called <v>Fiorella's</v> and information about it can be found here: http://www.fiorellasnewton.com/

09/23 - <v>Ole Mexican Grill</v> - Restaurants: $67.00

08/04 - <v>Nick House Pizza</v> - Restaurants: $32.00

Well, there's The <v>Daily Catch</v> on Hanover St., <v>Giacomo's</v> on Hanover St., 
<v>Cantina Italiana</v> on Hanover St., <v>Limoncello</v> on North St., and <v>Massimino's</v> on Endicott St. 

How about the <v>Starbucks</v> at <v>Levi Plaza</v>

<v>Masa</v> in the <v>South End</v> came to my mind first for Tapas, but it's not really on the way. 

much quieter and more relaxing than the <v>Legal Sea foods</v> at <v>Prudential Center</v>.

<v>Bristol Lounge</v> at the <v>Four Seasons</v>, <v>Bar at the Taj</v>, and <v>Oak Bar</v> at the <v>Copley</v>, are GREAT bars.

An old standby in the <v>South End</v> is <v>Hamersley's Bistro</v>. It leans French, but is not real traditional French. Take a look at the menu.

Any chance you can meet somewhere downtown instead of <v>Kendall</v>, say <v>Petit Robert Central</v> (same building as the downtown crossing T) or <v>Trade</v> (nearby to <v>South Station</v>)?

<v>Cambridge</v>/<v>Somerville</v> has <v>Club Passim</v>, <v>Johnny D's</v>, and the <v>Middle Eastern</v>.

Let's go to <v>Trina's</v>, because there's a small chance I'm going to the bar at <v>Oleana</v> this weekend.

I really like the <v>Summer Shack</v> on Dalton street. 

There's <v>Mike's Pastry</v> and <v>Modern</v>. Big debate over which one is better. 

Saturday at <v>Normas Burgers</v> 1200 pm

Am here and planning on meeting you tomorrow, 10 am at <v>Starbucks</v>?

08/06 - <v>Five Horses Tavern</v> - Restaurants: $52.00

Since you are staying at the <v>Omni Parker House</v> you must have a slice of their amazing Boston Cream pie in <v>Parker's</v>.. Yum-O!

In addition to our burgers at <v>Mr Bartley's</v>, the Mr and I enjoyed a burger at the <v>Warren Tavern</v> in <v>Charlestown</v>.

Check out <v>Island Creek Oyster</v> or <v>Citizen Public House</v>.

Anyone who wants to come to yoga, meet at <v>Gantcher</v> at 8 p.m.

<v>Bistro du Midi</v> also has great food, slightly more casual & a gorgeous view of Boston Garden.

<v>Bova's</v> is opened all 24/7.

Party Outside <v>Moksa</v> Restaurant in <v>Central Square</v> on 450 Massachusetts Avenue in the <v>Central Square</v> area

<v>Top of the Hub</v> - This is a restaurant on the top of the <v>Prudential Center</v>. Great views and great food. Has something for everyone.

Obies Night Out! <v>Scholars</v> American Bistro and Cocktail Lounge.

The <v>Capital Grill</v> or <v>Grill 23</v> are both really nice.

<v>J.J. Foley's</v> is a true Irish-American pub, bar and restaurant, offering the best authentic Irish pub food in <v>Boston</v>.

definitely try <v>Papagayo</v>, Mexican (about three blocks from <v>South Station</v>, away from downtown)

The <v>Beehive</v> http://www.beehiveboston.com/ - big, fun, live music

I would like to recommend <v>Bistro du Midi</v> which has a Provencal French menu.

If you like Tex Mex food, the restaurant <v>Zuma</v> is also decent. It's on the lower level of the North Market Building.

Especially at <v>Toro</v>, there can be a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night.

I just ate at <v>Area Four</v> in <v>Kendall Square</v> this past weekend and it was good (we had pizza).

I usually go to <v>Boston Beer Works</v> before the game and then <v>Cask n Flagon</v> after the game for a few drinks. Lots of choices around there!

To add to the restaurant list, my South End favorite is a simple place with fantastic pizza: <v>PICCO</v>.

<v>Cask n' flagon</v> tends to get very busy on game day including most bars in the area.

I'd recommend the <v>Museum of Science</v> if you like science

My favorite steak house in <v>Boston</v> right now is <v>Flemings Prime</v>, in <v>Park Square</v>.

Consider <v>Ruth's Chris</v>

There are a lot of restaurants in that area. One that comes to mind is the <v>Salty Dog</v>. I've eaten there at least a couple of times. 
I didn't expect much because it is such a touristy area, but the food was actually pretty good.

Consider <v>La Voile</v>, Newbury St., <v>Brasserie Jo</v>, Huntington Ave., <v>Lala Rohk</v>, Mt. Vernon St. (Persian food).

For a more elegant experience, <v>Mamma Maria</v> is wonderful. 

A couple of suggestions: the <v>Parish Cafe</v> on Boylston St., <v>Stephanies</v> on Newbury St., and <v>Joe's American Bar</v> on Newbury. All are casual and you can order from any part of the menu.

These days I like <v>Belly</v> Wine Bar at One Kendall.

Cambridge/Somerville has <v>Club Passim</v>, <v>Johnny D's</v>, and the <v>Middle East</v>.

So here are some ideas - dinner and/or drinks Or maybe.... - trampolines pizza and music (Saturdays at <v>skyzone</v>).

My favorites, of the places already mentioned, are <v>Cuchi Cuchi</v>, <v>Kika</v> and <v>Sarma</v>. 

Like 6:30 or so at <v>wynkoop</v> or <v>osteria Marco</v>?

<v>Regina's</v> has excellent pizza!

Places around <v>South Station</v> that I suggest for business lunches: 
- <v>Les Zygomates</v> (between <v>South Station</v> and <v>Chinatown</v>) 
- <v>Good Life</v> (between <v>South Station</v> and Downtown Crossing) 
- <v>Kingston Station</v> (between <v>South Station</v> and Downtown Crossing) 
- <v>Lucky's</v> (Congress Street, Fort Point Channel) 
- <v>Cafe 300</v> / <v>Channel Cafe</v> (Summer Street, Fort Point Channel) 
- <v>Papagayo</v>, Mexican (Summer Street, Fort Point Channel) 
Plus some other options, generally more expensive than the above: 
- <v>Trade</v>, probably would require reservation (one block from <v>South Station</v>) 
- <v>Papagayo</v>, Mexican (about three blocks from <v>South Station</v>, away from downtown) 
- <v>Empire</v>, haven't been there but sounds interesting (by the Courthouse) 
- <v>Strega - Waterfront</v> (by the Courthouse) 
- <v>Legal Harborside</v> (past the World Trade Center) 
- <v>Legal Test Kitchen</v> (past the World Trade Center)

Come celebrate my bday at <v>Baker's</v> for dinner!!!

we're going to meet at 6:30 PM at the <v>Watch City Brewing Co</v>. (found here: http://watchcitybrew.com/), enjoy some food and drinks, and generally have a good time!  The restaurant's located on Moody St., so it should be pretty convenient for anyone in the area. 

Our admissions directors will be present to answer all of your questions about Hult's top-ranked programs. <v>Sonsie</v> Restaurant, Wine Room (downstairs).

I would recommend getting a reservation at The <v>Hawthorne</v>. 

although the close pretty early so that may not work out...theres always <v>annas</v>...

I like <v>Abe and Louies</v> and <v>Capital Grille</v>.

I'd recommend the <v>Museum of Fine art</v> if you like to see fine art

I like <v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v>. Great drinks and bartenders, very tasty food -- try a burger with fried oysters on top. Mmmmm!

So I think we should all meet ~7:30 at 211 to head to <v>Redbones</v>.

Anyhow I was wondering who was interested in doing a little sailing at the lake around 4:30/5 this evening then head to <v>Redbones</v> for dinner

Is anyone coming to <v>annas</v> with me :(? 

Jamie's mom made a reservation for 13 at <v>La Summa</v> at 8pm! 

I would agree with <v>Maggiano's</v>. 

Places around <v>South Station</v> that I suggest for business lunches: 
- <v>Les Zygomates</v> (between <v>South Station</v> and <v>Chinatown</v>) 
- <v>Good Life</v> (between <v>South Station</v> and Downtown Crossing)

- <v>Papagayo</v>, Mexican (Summer Street, Fort Point Channel) 
Plus some other options, generally more expensive than the above: 
- <v>Trade</v>, probably would require reservation (one block from <v>South Station</v>) 
- <v>Papagayo</v>, Mexican (about three blocks from <v>South Station</v>, away from downtown) 
- <v>Empire</v>, haven't been there but sounds interesting (by the Courthouse) 
- <v>Strega - Waterfront</v> (by the Courthouse) 
- <v>Legal Harborside</v> (past the World Trade Center) 
- <v>Legal Test Kitchen</v> (past the World Trade Center)

Lunch tomorrow at <v>area four</v>

Thursday works.  How about 2pm at <v>Barrington Coffee Roasting Company</v>?

<v>Teatro</v>, <v>PF Chang's</v>, <v>Rustic Kitchen</v> and there are a few others in the area. 

<v>Mr. Bartleys</v> will be slammed during the races, and it is small. 

A decent breakfast spot not too far outside Harvard Square is <v>Zoe's</v>. It is a reasonably priced Greek diner type place on Mass Ave with an extensive menu.

<v>East Side bar and Grill</v> and <v>Mr. bartley's</v> might be good options. 

It's a chain, but there is a <v>Del Frisco</v> steak house on the water right by <v>Legal</v>.

The <v>Peabody-Essex Museum</v> has an outstanding collection of historic homes and maritime art (and more).

<v>Dunkin Donuts</v> will be open early, no worries there.

We'll drive to Foxboro to visit <v>Gillette Stadium</v> as well as the <v>Hall</v>. 

<v>Ten Tables Cambridge</v>, <v>Posto</v> or <v>Oishii Boston</v>. I mostly like those places. 

<v>Blu</v> has a decent view from what I remember - also been a while!

Here are recent check ins: <v>El centro</v>, <v>one Caroline street bistro</v>, <v>mistral</v>, <v>blue dragon</v>, <v>legal seafood by waterfront</v>

How about 3:30pm at <v>Barrington Coffee</v> Roasters?

There is an excellent exhibit at the <v>Peabody Essex Museum</v> on mid-century modern California design 1930-1965.

Other venues with nice view - the new <v>Legal Seafood</v> Harborside.

7/19: Harpoon Tap Takeover at <v>Champions</v> (Boston, MA) MORE INFO (http://harpoonbrewery.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c98c3073d94d982bcec7d1beb&id=ae4a3f748b&e=2172b3d4d8)

I just looked at Yelp and saw a place called the <v>Red Derby</v>....a bar that is closer to where you are and outside the city center.

I was also going to suggest <v>Brasserie Jo</v> and <v>Pho Basil</v>. 

<v>Tavern Road</v> http://tavernroad.com/ - new & very good, hipstery

Right in the <v>Theater District</v> is the <v>Emerald Lounge</v> in the <v>Revere Hotel</v>. 

I agree with Bean's suggestions of <v>Durgin Park</v> and <v>Union Oyster House</v>

<v>Fig's</v> on Charles Street in <v>Boston</v> and also in <v>Charlestown</v>.

The <v>Miracle of Science Bar and Grill</v> is a good spot.

<v>ANNAS</v> FOR DINNER!!!!!

How about <v>Mulan</v>?

Yeah, <v>mit library</v> would be cool, if we can get on the wifi there?

You could have dinner at <v>Eastern Standard</v> or <v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v>.

I think we want <v>Hayden library</v>.

<v>Legal Seafood</v> at the <v>Charles Hotel</v> is a good moderate choice.

Dinner: Italian in the <v>North End</v>. I am a bit old school so <v>Lucia Ristorante</v> on Hanover St. is a good value.

want to try the <v>Local</v> or the <v>Dolphin</v>?

Okay. Colin, vicki and I say meet at <v>Anna's</v> in <v>Davis</v> at 7:30.

<v>James Hook</v> Lobster is probably the closest to what you are looking for

<v>Grafton Street Pub</v> is a nice atmosphere and moderately priced.

Another option is <v>Fire & Ice</v> which is right next door to <v>Border Cafe</v>.

there's a <v>Panera Bread</v> at the corner of Gainsborough Street

You could make it easier on yourself and just take the Green Line two stops to the <v>Museum of Science</v> stop.

We had a lovely meal in the <v>Franklin Cafe</v> earlier this month - just a short cab ride from <v>Back Bay</v> area.

I recommend drinks at the <v>Top of the Hub</v> for the view (it's at the <v>Prudential Center</v>).

<v>Sportello</v> is another favorite of mine. 

Maybe <v>red rock</v> in <v>swampscott</v>?

Just went to <v>Sarma</v> a few weeks ago - yum!

but if you do down to <v>Legal Harborside</v>, you could also check out the <v>Atlantic Beer Garden</v> (same street). 

<v>Posto</v> is good, pricey but good. 

If Central Square is an option, maybe <v>Brick and Mortar</v> or <v>Green Street</v> grill?

If you like Thai food, <v>Montien</v> on Stuart Street is another good choice.

FYI, both <v>Toro</v> and <v>Orinoco</v> are notorious for having long lines to get in. 

I concur regarding the <v>Union Oyster House</v>- established in 1826- great place for a lobster roll!

Kyle has an interview at 330 and then around 6 we will probs go to <v>hookah</v> or something

The restaurant is called <v>Fiorella's</v>. The address of the restaurant is: 187 North St, Newton, MA 02460

<v>Sarma</v> is excellent but way out of the way for you. 

If you wanted just chowder and maybe crab cakes, you could try <v>Legal Seafood</v> in the <v>Prudential</v>, or, even closer, in <v>Copley Place</v>.

If you are looking for really good sandwich, salad or soup, you might want to try <v>Flour Bakery</v> on Clarendon Street.

Or you can go across the street to the Student Center for <v>Anna's Taqueria</v>.

<v>Upper Crust</v> (various locations, including Cambridge, I think)

When we go to <v>Fenway</v> for the game, should we eat inside the park or should we eat something before we go in?

I will be taking Neil to his scratch programming class next Sunday at around 2:30 and we should talk later to see if Spencer is interested for the next session at <v>Einstein's</v> and we could car pool their activities.

wanna get some sandwiches at <v>Commonwealth</v>?

I don't know anything about <v>Bee's Knees</v>.

Let's do Wednesday the 22nd at <v>life alive</v>, 9:15.

<v>Teatro</v> is also good, been there forever & is consistent & typically bustling. Also only open for dinner. http://www.teatroboston.com/

Going to a Red Sox baseball game at <v>Fenway Park</v> this week!

You're welcome to join, or I'll just meet you at <v>legal sea foods</v> around 4.

If you want a strictly Seafood restaurant with little to no meat on the menu, you could try <v>Row 34</v> in <v>Fort Point</v>.

<v>Coppa</v> (same chef as <v>Toro</v>) does fabulous small plates & recently winner of the James Beard award! 

I enjoy the food at the <v>Top of The Hub</v>. I prefer to sit in their lounge with their live Jazz music. It can be a romantic place.

If you don't mind a walk, I would suggest walking over to 3rd Street west of Binney Street, where the <v>Voltage</v> Coffehouse is located.

Breakfast: Walk across the <v>Boston Common</v> to the Paramount.

I would second the choice of <v>Rendezvous</v> if you go to Central Sq.

I like <v>Mare</v>...but my favorites are <v>L'Osteria</v> and <v>Pagliuca's</v>, both pretty casual and both with a more traditional North End atmosphere than <v>Mare</v>.

<v>WAGAMAMA</v>!!! Has the massage already been covered? I would go in on that as well.

If you like Thai food, <v>Montien</v> on Stuart St. is close and is an excellent restaurant.

You could also go see the <v>West End gym</v> in <v>Lowell</v> where much of the Fighter was filmed. It's pretty cool.

Let's plan to meet at <v>Manhattan Sandwich Co</v> at 7am tomorrow.

Would you like to meet for drinks Friday night at <v>Applebee's</v>?

I'd be more inclined to get something from <v>Mike's Pastry</v> in the <v>North End</v> for a sweet treat.

I second The <v>Salty Dog</v>. It's quite good considering it's location.

Kate is the <v>Reef</v>? that is a great suggestion!

Try <v>Smith & Wollensky</v> or <v>Abe & Louie's</v> for steak.

Boston - <v>Pizzeria Regina</v> on Thacher Streeet

So here's one suggestion. You can drive to <v>Mike's City Diner</v> in <v>Boston</v>'s <v>South End</v>. Since it's a Sunday, if you get there early in the morning.

<v>Easter Standard</v> is one of my favorites but like others have said, make a reservation and check out the menu beforehand.

I'd add <v>Salty Dog</v> at <v>Faneuil Hall</v> and <v>James Hook</v>.

and the <v>Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</v> (also in <v>Boston</v>) is open on Thursdays until 9:00. 

also in the <v>Back Bay</v> at the <v>Prudential Center</v>, too

<v>Oleana</v> is also very good. <v>Oleana's</v> chef also runs <v>Sarma</v>, I'm guessing you know that.

You mention the <v>Parish Cafe</v>. It's famous for having several Boston chefs contribute sandwiches and light dishes to the menu.

I love <v>Ristorante Fiore</v> --- 250 Hanover Street. Great food, reasonable prices, beautiful atmosphere.

We had heard of <v>Santarpios</v> and were going between that and <v>Regina</v> for pizza. 

For Seafood try <v>Legal Seafood</v> near the <v>Aquarium</v>.

I also second <v>Flour</v>. <v>Flour</v> has delicious sandwiches and you should try their sticky buns! the best ever!

some place with nice outdoor seating? For that I like <v>Oleana's</v> but it's in <v>Cambridge</v>. 

Yes, we're still on for tonight and I'm looking forward to it! See you at 7p at <v>Belly</v>.

<v>Sorelle Bakery Cafe</v> - Restaurants: $4.55

Yeah, next Friday for lunch at <v>sweetgreen</v>

A few of us were talking about how we havent tried <v>Gargoyles</v>, the <v>Foundry</v> and <v>Flatbread</v>.

I'm a big fan of <v>Erbaluce</v> in <v>Bay Village</v>.

7/11: Friend of Harpoon Night at <v>Rocco's Restaurant</v> (Wilmington, MA) MORE INFO (http://harpoonbrewery.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=c98c3073d94d982bcec7d1beb&id=1efa6e945b&e=2172b3d4d8)

Both <v>Trade</v> & <v>Nebo</v> look out onto the Financial District & the Greenway park. Good food at both.

Italian Seafood: <v>Mare</v> or <v>Daily Catch</v>

Here are recent check ins: <v>El centro</v>, <v>one Caroline street bistro</v>, <v>mistral</v>, <v>blue dragon</v>, <v>legal sea food</v>

If you love pasta, and don't mind waiting in a line and paying cash, <v>Giacomo's</v> is very very good as well.

Nice View = <v>Top of The Hub</v>

<v>Coppa</v> is fabulous. We were there most recently on Tuesday (the day after Jamie's win) & it was better than ever.

<v>Finz</v> is a fun waterfront restaurant at Pickering Wharf.

a friend who lives in da 'ville goes to <v>Saccos</v> a couple times a year and likes the pizza there.

Another restaurant close to your hotel is <v>Erbaluce</v>.

<v>Erbaluce</v> is wonderful, regional, seasonal Italian! Only open for dinner. http://www.erbaluce-boston.com/index.html

Karl -- <v>Papagayo</v> can get surprisingly busy, so I recommend a reservation.

I'll be right near <v>Firebrand Saints</v> - let's plan for a bit after 6.

In <v>Kendall</v>, I could do <v>Firebrand Saints</v> or maybe the bar at <v>Evoo</v>.

How about <v>row 34</v>?

Would the same plan work for you of 9:15am at <v>Life Alive</v> on Thursday?

I spent an evening at the <v>Emerald Lounge</v> in April for my birthday & it is mostly definitely a club!

Are we still on for lunch to day at noon at <v>Stephi's</v>?

Sounds good. See you at noon at <v>Dumpling Cafe</v>.

An Italian Sausage with peppers or a Fenway Frank are my favorite ball time eats at <v>Fenway</v>!

<v>Bond</v> http://www.bondboston.com/ - loungey & very fabulous

<v>Wink & Nod</v> http://www.winkandnod.com/ - lots of new buzz, but haven't been yet

<v>Chic</v>, relaxed, hip-ish young Paris neighborhood. Good wine and good food, simple menu.

The <v>Bristol Lounge</v> is very old school <v>Four Seasons</v> bar. It's lovely, great service, expensive for sure but not very hip.

<v>Oleana</v> (sister restaurant to <v>Sarma</v>) also has a lot of small plates on their menu

Let's do <v>Swiss</v> bakery. 

I don't know <v>Harry's</v> but I definitely would not call <v>Post 390</v> pub like. 

I was pleasantly surprised to see the <v>Citizen</v>, the <v>Gallows</v>, and <v>East by Northeast</v> on there

It may not be the best restaurant in <v>Boston</v>, but I think <v>Eastern Standard</v> Kitchen has a lot of legitimate potential.

Next weekend (the 19th) is the last weekend <v>Sunday River</v> is open.

Let's start a break with a nice breakfast in <v>In a pickle</v>. Let's meet there (265 Moody St, Waltham) around 9:00 am.

I work across the street from <v>Anna's</v> so that's an option too.

Head count for who wants to go to <v>Rock Bottom</v> in <v>Westminster</v>!

And then theres the classic <v>Redbones</v>. 

I won't be done with work in time but I'd love to meet up for <v>redbones</v>. 

Otherwise, if you know they like beef, one of the high end steakhouses, like <v>Grill 23</v> or the <v>Capital Grille</v>.

I don't love most of the food court options at <v>Faneuil Hall</v>, but do really enjoy <v>Wagamama</v> for Japanese noodles.

There's a huge food court-like area in <v>Quincy Market</v>

<v>Russel House</v> is much larger & can be loud (in the tavern sort of way)

I'd recommend the <v>New England aquarium</v> is you like to see sea life.

The <v>Big Apple Circus</v> is in town on <v>City Hall Plaza</v> (right near <v>Quincy Market</v>) 

3. Getting a whole bunch of friends up to <v>Sunday River</v> in January for some great skiing.

<v>Eastern Standard</v>? <v>Legal</v>'s is always good too. The new Harborside one is nice. <v>Strega Waterfront</v> is bomb. Pretty much anywhere in the <v>North End</v>.

Aside from the fantastic food and local atmosphere of <v>Franklin Cafe</v>, they, too, are open late for dinner. 

I've only been to <v>Casa Romero</v> once before

We are going to grab a drink at <v>Shojo</v> on Tyler street

<v>Top of the Hub</v>? may need a rservation

A bit further away on Mass ave towards Central square, there's <v>Zoe's</v>. It's a Greek/American retro diner.

Or <v>Trina's</v>?

For good US style pizza - <v>Regina's</v>. 

Definitely do the <v>Freedom Trail</v>. If you want to get max benefit and entertainment, take a guided tour.

What about <v>Abe and Louies</v>? Anywhere else?

What: iPhone When: Saturday, November 9, 2013 at 11:30 AM Where: <v>Apple Store</v>, CambridgeSide

<v>Smith and Wollensky</v>!!!! http://www.smithandwollensky.com/

It's a building on the corner of Farnsworth and Congress st., across from the <v>Boston Fire Museum</v>.

I recommend the <v>North End</v> as well, I would probably eat at <v>Mamma Maria</v> which is just off of Hanover Street.

<v>City Table</v> on Thursday the 16th works.

Thank you for choosing <v>Row 34</v>. Should your plans change, please let us know. We look forward to serving you. Eat Oysters.

one of the finest "dive bars" in <v>Boston</v> is across the street, on the corner of A St. and Congress. It's called <v>Lucky's</v>. 

There will be awesome and delicious visits to <v>Dave's Fresh Pasta</v>, <v>Diva Indian Bistro</v> and <v>Oasis Brazilian Restaurant</v>.

There's a <v>Starbucks</v> in the <v>Cambridgeside Galleria</v> shopping mall across the street from your hotel.

If you are in the <v>South End</v>, for lunch or a late night snack, <v>Francesca's</v> is pretty good.

How's 2:30 at <v>barrington coffee</v> roasters on congress street?

the closest I've had to the pizza served in <v>Naples</v> is <v>Angela's</v> coal-fired pizza in <v>Saugus</v>.

Must Eat RW (although some may be booked up). <v>Mistral</v>, <v>Sorellina</v>, <v>Scampo</v>, <v>Beacon Hill Bistro</v>, <v>Oceanaire</v>, <v>Oishii</v>.

There are loads of good restaurants in the <v>South End</v>--try <v>Toro</v>, <v>Coppa</v>, <v>Franklin Cafe</v>.

<v>Haymarket</v> is open on Fridays and Saturdays

The <v>Hawthorne</v> at the <v>Commonwealth Hotel</v> is pretty well-know for their cocktails. 

My favorite North End Italian is <v>Pomodoro</v>, which is a tiny hole in the wall place with no ambiance but great food. 

However, <v>Union Oyster House</v> which is right in the same area is worth a visit

<v>Capital Grill</v> or <v>Grill 23</v> have good steak.

I used to go to <v>Gourmet Decisions</v> for breakfast a lot.

Any of the restaurants in the <v>South End</v> are close, but not really the most scenic of walks...
<v>Hammersley's Bistro</v>, <V>Aquaitaine</v>, <v>B & G Oysters</v>, <v>Franklin Cafe</v>, <v>647 Tremont</v>, <v>Grille 23</v>

Have you been to Harvard's <v>Museum of Natural History</v>? The glass flowers are amazing.

Also <v>Finale</v> at <v>Park Plaza</v> (and at <v>Harvard</v>) 

I've been to <v>Johnny D's</v> and <v>Joshua Tree</v> too

We love to stop into <v>Farm and Fable</v> across the street to see what's new in vintage cookbooks and wonderful old cooking and tableware. 

<v>Joe's Bar & Grill</v> or <v>Tia's</v> near Long Wharf offer a nice view, casual eating, decent food & outdoor seating if the weather is nice.

Anybody want to go to <v>Old Chicago</v> and grab a beer or two?

<v>Cannoli</v> in the <v>North End</v>. 

There are other lunch options in the <v>Kendall Square</v> area as well, including <v>Cosi</v> for sandwiches.

don't go to <v>Mikes Pastry</v>

The food inside <v>Fenway</v> is meh

If it's museums only and the <v>Harvard Museum of Natural history</v> is of particular interest

Would <v>Fiorella's</v> in <v>Newton</v> be too far? 

I second the <v>Bristol Lounge</v> at the <v>Four Seasons Hotel</v>.

how about group breakfast this saturday at <v>in a pickle</v>

Steak without a view: Boston has just about all of the typical steak house chains. Locally-owned steak places include <v>Grill 23</v>, and <v>Abe & Louies</v>

If you felt like going to Harvard Square, I really like <v>Harvest</v>.

Following the exhibit viewing join fellow Obies for drinks at 7:15PM at <v>J.J. Foley's</v> Irish Pub & Restaurant in the <v>South End</v>, 117 East Berkeley Street, South End Boston.  There is a spot reserved for Oberlin in the bar area so be sure to wear your Oberlin gear to find other Boston area Obies!

But if you do end up in <v>East Cambridge</v>, head up the street to the <v>Atwood's Tavern</v>

I'd recommend the <v>Institute of Contemporary art</v> is you like contemporary art

<v>Brasserie Jo's</v> is uneven, so I would not keep it on your list. 

another alternative would be to go get a drink at our favorite bar <v>Cheshire</v>, walk to the nearby delicious delicious <v>napa woodfired pizza</v>.

<v>East Side bar and Grille</v> and <v>Mr. bartley's</v> might be good options. 

It's called <v>Lumiere</v> and it's located at 1293 Washington St. in <v>West Newton</v>, a very modern french cuisine restaurant.

I'm not really a <v>Legal Sea foods</v> fan, personally but the Harborside location has a nice view.

<v>Finale</v> in <v>cambridge</v> is a dessert focused place. They have a dessert sampler that is awesome.

I think <v>Sarma</v> might be 11 minutes if there is no traffic at all, but at dinner time, I think it would take longer to get there. Maybe 20 minutes?

I think the place Bob is trying to remember is <v>Antonio's</v> on Cambridge St. It's very good actually. 

You might go to <v>Pizzeria Regina</v> in the <v>North End</v>, for the excellent pizza

The <v>Pizzeria Regina</v> at <v>Quincy Market</v> is not as good

another alternative would be to go get a drink at our favorite bar <v>Cheshire</v>, walk to the nearby delicious delicious <v>napa</v> woodfired pizza.

You can get a great meal across Huntington Avenue at <v>Brasserie Jo</v> in the <v>Colonnade Hotel</v>.

Another place to consider is <v>Fairsted Kitchen</v> in <v>Brookline</v>:

Another very nice restaurant is <v>Mamma Maria</v> in the <v>North End</v>. 

The <v>Bar at the Taj</v> Hotel is nice, too, as well as <v>Oak Bar</v> at the <v>Copley Plaza</v>.

How about <v>Boston Common Coffee</v> on High Street, just 2 blocks from <v>South Station</v>.

Love <v>EVOO</v> and <v>Catalyst</v>. Maybe <v>Abigail's</v> as another option?

<v>Modern Pastry</v> also just opened its expanded space next door. We should totally go.

Cross country skiing tomorrow at <v>keystone</v>?

How about breakfast at <v>City Table</v> in the <v>Lenox</v> on Thursday the 16th?

Want to grab lunch at <v>Mulan</v>?

<v>Farmstead Table</v> in <v>Newton Center</v>

<v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> for seafood, but make reservations on game days.

05/03 - <v>Barracuda Tavern</v> - Restaurants: $22.88

<v>Legal</v> is famous for chowder.

I can recommend <v>Rendezvous</v> in Central Square

<v>Boston</v> has some amazing art museums - like the <v>Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</v>.

Add <v>Kika</v> to the list for tapas if you're in the <v>Kendall Square</v> area of Cambridge .

Next wednesday before senior gala, there is a mass exodus by the sailing team to a little restaurant known as <v>Jose's</v>

Breakfast... there are <v>dunkin donuts</v> everywhere!!! 

Incidentally, I think going to a game at <v>Fenway</v> is pretty touristy these days.

but not as touristy as the <v>Cheers</v> bar, which is a place no local would be caught dead in.

For the Sox, there are tons of bars in the area- <v>Cask and Flagon</v> would be a good one to go to amongst many.

For movies, if you want to see any while you're here, there's a big <v>Loews</v> theater across from the <v>Boston Common</v> that does all the major releases. 

<v>Sportello</v> can be Italian small plates since they offer all their pastas as half portions.

If you can walk a little further the <v>Friendly Toast</v> at 1 Kendall Square is a popular spot with lots of breakfast options. 

Steakhouse: <v>Abe and Louies</v>

I think all the recommendations so far are solid with <v>Massimino's</v> and <v>Ricardo's</v> being my favorite amoung them.

For red sauce Italian-American I like <v>Cantina Italiana</v>. 

There is also <v>Au bon pain</v> both in the <v>Pru</v> and in <v>Copley Place</v>.

Arriving No Station via Amtrak & heading to <v>Science Museum</v> on Sat.

I have also been to <v>Brasserie Jo</v>, which is also nice...

The <v>Midtown</v> is almost right across the street from the <v>Prudential Center</v>. 

If it is last minute and <v>burger king</v>.

<v>Picco</v> Pizza (<v>South End</v>)

<v>Doyle's</v> is an Institution in <v>JP</v> and I recommend a visit.

You should also try Skee Ball if you go to <v>Kings</v> - very traditional New England game.

I hear that <v>Island Creek</v> is great. 

<v>Durgin Park</v> or <v>Ned Devine's</v> would be fine. <v>Ned Devine's</v> also has seating upstairs and outside.

If you don't feel like going to the campus and would like to get some work done, we could go to in <v>Cafe on the Common</v> in <v>Waltham</v>.

How about 9:15am at the <v>Starbucks</v> at the corner of prospect and mass ave.?

I know I've told you I (and maybe my wife) would be there <v>In a Pickle</v>, but I'm really sorry that I turned out not to be able to make it today.

Gala is Tuesday, and we should go to <v>Jose's</v> beforehand

I like <v>Taranta</v> in the <v>North End</v>.

I was looking at <v>Legal Seafood</v> at Park Square since it is close to the common.

We're going for a <v>Fenway Park</v> tour.

Amazon Cambridge is sponsoring a Social Hour this month at The <v>Blue Room</v> in <v>Kendall Square</v>.

<v>Ritu Ki Rasoi</v> does a Sat/Sun lunch buffet from noon to 3. 

<v>Abe and Louie's</v> is fine, but very loud. <v>Oak Room</v> has better atmosphere as do <v>Capital Grille</v> and <v>Grille 23</v>, as well as <v>Mooo</v> and <v>KO Prime</v>.

If you are flat out against a chain place, you could also try <v>Mooo</v> at the <v>XV Beacon hotel</v>. It's more expensive, but the food is very good.

Event details: the <v>Blue Room</v>, One Kendall Square , Cambridge, MA 02139. Thursday, March 20th, 5:30 – 7:30pm

Or we could keep it simple and do <v>Annas</v>. 

Your reservation with <v>Ristorante Olivio</v> is confirmed for 2 person(s) on March 26, 2014 at 07:00 PM. It is located at: 201 Massachusetts Avenue, Arlington - 02474

The <v>Bristol Lounge</v> is the restaurant at the <v>Four Seasons</v>. 

Reservations have been made in Matt Khourie's name at <v>Capital Grille</v>, located at 5365 Westheimer Road (in the <v>Galleria</v> area), at 7:00 p.m.

<v>Children's museum</v> is free after 5pm on Fridays, gets more crowded but would save money since you mention a budget. 

Night skiing at <v>Keystone</v>?

The <v>Hyatt</v> would have one of the best views of the fireworks. 

I like <v>Eastern Standard</v>, but more for the cocktails than the food.

<v>Gargoyles</v> or <v>Redbones</v> in <v>Davis</v>? 

Yes, there's a <v>Legal Sea foods</v> in <v>Copley Place</v> and another at the <v>Prudential Center</v>, so you can walk to two of them in the rain and never wet your feet.

If you do go to <v>Davis Square</v> and are looking for dive bars, check out <v>Sligo</v>.

Happy to meet and chat more - scheduling is a near and dear topic to my heart given how much time I have wasted on it :) Want to meet at the <v>starbucks</v> across from <v>South Station</v> next Mon at 130pm?

<v>Redbones</v>/ <v>underbones</v> could be a good choice! Although I get BBQ all the time in <v>TX</v>. Haha, really anywhere in <v>Davis</v> works for me.

You can take the T to <v>Davis square</v> Somerville for Candlepin Bowling at <v>Sacco's Bowl Haven</v>.

I also recommend <v>Eastern Standard</v>. Make a reservation now. Don't wait.

<v>Randolph</v> is actually pretty close to <v>Boston</v>

(After 4.5 months of 70 hr weeks of managing at <v>Craigie</v>, I decided to move on - and that restaurants might not be for me.)

How about <v>Trattoria di Monica</v> on Prince Street

<v>Skywalk Observatory</v> at The <v>Prudential Center</v>/Tower - may consider lunch or drinks at Tob of the Hub instead / as well.

Seafood: <v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v>

Hey guys, I was wondering if you all might be interested in going to have Peking Duck at <v>Great China</v>.

I'd recommend the <v>Natural History museum</v> is you like natural history, 

I know there's a <v>Starbucks</v> in <v>Central</v>, that could work.

you could try <v>Teranga</v>. It's a Senagalese restaurant.

For true Neapolitan style pizza, <v>Gran Gusto</v> in <v>Cambridge</v>. 

<v>Amami Restaurant</v> - Restaurants: $92.71

For a great burger (one of our all-time favorites) go to <v>Mr. Bartley's Burger Cottage</v> in <v>Harvard Square</v>.

<v>Toro</v> has wonderful Tapas and other Spanish theme dishes.

Earlier in the week we had lunch on the patio at <v>Coppa</v>.

<v>Fire & Ice</v>. It's an urbanized Mongolian BBQ, so it's got great variety and is all-you-can eat (

I like the atmosphere at the <v>Oak Room</v> (it has kind of an Old World charm), 

Mexican: My favorite Mexican place is <v>Anna's Taqueria</v>. 

We walked into <v>Orinoco</v> at 6:15 and were the second table seated for the evening.

I take Neil out to <v>Einstein's</v> at around 2:15-2:30 for his class at 3:15.

The <v>Peabody Essex Museum</v> is Salem's gem. 

could try <v>Parish Cafe</v> on Boylston Street

in <v>North End</v>, <v>Mamma Maria</v> is the closest 

Went to <v>Blue Dragon</v> last weekend...very good

No contest -- best chowder anywhere is at any <v>Legal Sea foods</v> (not the biggest fan of the rest of their food though).

Plenty of bars around Fenway, all will have a good crowd and atmosphere on game day. <v>Jerry Remys</v> and <v>Cask n Flagon</v> are a couple I've been to repeatedly.

<v>Henrietta's Table</v> is a nice spot for a special breakfast. It's at the <v>Charles Hotel</v> right at <v>Harvard Square</v>.

We used to ski with Rich & Carol up at <v>Sunday River</v> with the Olsons.

If you can get the required letter and snail mail it to us, maybe we can pick up your season passes for you when we're up at <v>Sunday River</v>

The event will be at one of the local tufts bars (<v>Burren</v>, <v>J-Tree</v>, or <v>Sagra</v>) on an off-night where the bar usually does not have much of a night scene.

The big news is that Dave is taking us to <v>Finz</v> in <v>Salem</v> at 8 PM on Saturday night.

Take a look at <v>Grill 23</v>. It's a local favorite and a very nice steakhouse.

could go, check out fish at <v>New England Aquarium</v>

For a chain with a unique location (water view) there is <v>Del Frisco's</v>.

After dinner we have tickets at <v>Fenway</v> to see the Red Sox.

Another nearby option is <v>Via Matta</v>, which is fun, modern & open for lunch & dinner during the week, dinner only on Saturday & closed on Sunday. www.viamattarestaurant.com/index_flash.htm

For the red sauce Italian-American you're looking for a place I like is <v>Cantina Italiana</v>. 

<v>Dali</v> was fun and different! and it's been a while since they've been there.

<v>Union Oyster House</v> is over priced and over rated. 

<v>Menton</v> and <v>L'Espalier</v> both have the option for lengthy fine dining dinners.

Or, if you are not looking for obscure cocktails, the <v>Bristol Lounge</v> is a great suggestion.

You may also consider some Northern Italian restaurants in the <v>North End</v>, such as <v>Prezza</v> that specialize in steak.

Yes! And then we ran into each other at <v>Tatte</v> like 20 times after that :)

We could go someplace in <v>Harvard</v> and then go to <v>Finale</v> after dinner for cake.

New to Tufts University. <v>Chef Co</v>, 14 Medford St http://www.elabs3.com/ct.html?rtr=on&s=iew,18h23,5bc6,gmbe,bobx,blno,5esu

<v>sweet green</v> on boylston street is a nice salad place.

<v>West Bridge</v> in <v>Kendall Sq</v>.?

Take the Blue Line out to Wonderland, and get a roast beef sandwich at <v>Kelly's</v>. 

I have to agree. My husband and I had a wonderful brunch on the patio at <v>Hamersley's</v> yesterday.

<v>Uni Sashimi Bar</v>, in your hotel, if you like sushi.

I made a reservation for <v>Jose's</v> for tomorrow night at 7.

Also the <v>Marliave</v> in <v>Downtown Crossing</v>, <v>Montien Thai</v> restaurant on Stuart St., <v>Vlora Mediterranean</v> restaurant on Boylston St., Korean restaurants in <v>Allston</v> (<v>Myeung Dong</v> 1st avenue and <v>Korea Garden</v> are my favorites)

For higher end Northern Italian there are <v>Prezza</v> and <v>Mamma Maria</v>.

For sure, how about <v>Oleana's</v> bar?

another place that I've just discovered recently, and has excellent food, is <v>Massiminos</v>.

Visit the colonial and late 18th century America exhibits in the <v>Museum of Fine Arts</v>' new Arts of the Americas wing.

If you don't mind a walk, I would suggest walking over to 3rd Street west of Binney Street, where the <v>Tatte Bakery</v> is located.

Yes! Apparently at <v>TD garden</v>.

<v>Top of the Hub</v> relies on it's view - the food is terrible. Fine for a drink though!

The best pizza in <v>Cambridge</v> is technically in <v>Somerville</v> at <v>Posto</v> Pizza across the parking lot from Porter Square.

If you go to the <v>Sam Adams brewery</v>, go to <v>Doyle's</v> afterwards. It's an old Boston bar with a lot of character.

Penny ... I haven't been to <v>Sacco's</v> since the pizza folks moved in ...

you all should come to the new <v>Sound Bites</v> restaurant on Tuesday night.

I would not call <v>Tia's</v> on the Waterfomt a "special occasion restaurant."

<v>Anthony's</v> in the <v>seaport</v> district is a classic.

Do you want to grab a drink Friday at <v>Lily's</v>? (Usertesting)

I second the rec for <v>Del Frisco's</v>. I went there for a blogger event, and the food was really good. 

My favorite north end restaurant is <v>Maria's</v> but they aren't opened as late as <v>Modern</v> and <v>Mike's</v>. 

<v>Prezza</v> in the <v>North End</v> is great for steak (among other things).

If you are looking for Sandwiches, <v>Crema Cafe</v> have great food

<v>Fig's</v> - A Todd English Restaurant

Hola - lets meet up for lunch at <v>Yank Sing</v> at the Rincon next Friday.

Happy Birthday. I can't make the lake but I am so down for <v>Redbones</v>.

<v>Del Frisco's</v> is another option if you want a harbor view while you eat.

will be near the <v>James Hook</v> Lobster Company

Basically, we're going to grab dinner at the <v>Watch City Brewing Co.</v> (found here: http://watchcitybrew.com/) in <v>Waltham</v> at 6:30 PM.  The restaurant is located on Moody St., so it should be pretty convenient for anyone who's in the area.

<v>Fairsted Kitchen</v> in <v>Washington Square</v>

more so than that at <v>Abe and Louies</v> anyway (which feels to me, like most steakhouses in town, kind of corporate and generic and while certainly expensive, not very special).

How about <v>New York Pizzeria</v> for lunch?  Another preference?  We could go to <v>Teala's</v> on Dallas.

We have a reservation at the <v>Grafton Street Pub & Grill</v>, in <v>Harvard Sq</v>.  We can fine-tune the plan later!

My first thought is <v>Ricardo's</v> too.

Yes, <v>Flour</v> is awesome - definitely worth checking out! 

I thought that <v>Bella Luna</v> had moved or closed so I'm glad it's still operating with bowling.

Are you thinking of <v>One of the Kind</v>? 

<v>Lo Conte</v> is on Salem street and very casual. 

We are having problems where to eat dinner 4th July. We were going to the <v>Hyatt Regency</v>, but had to cancel

If you like seafood might be worth trying <v>Legal Sea foods</v>. They are at several locations in the city. We had a great meal there!

<v>Tatte Bakery Cafe</v> - Restaurants: $11.69

<v>Sam Adams brewery</v> with the side trip to Doyle's is pretty touristy 

Take the Blue Line to Wonderland and go to <v>Kelly's Roast Beef</v> on Revere Beach.

That reminds me of <v>Top of the Hub</v> on top of the Prudential Building (50 stories up).

<v>Eastern Standard</v>?  I'd rather go to <v>Chili's</v>.

The <v>Bristol Lounge</v> is one that has been mentioned. 

I feel like <v>Stella</v> is certainly missing.

We asked at a restaurant in <v>Central</v> (<v>Garden at the Cellar</v>) about renting a room for the night, and it was 3,000 dollars not including food.

<v>Temptations cafe</v> on Huntington. Call before going.

For <v>North End</v>, if you want more Italian-American style, then <v>La Summa</v> and <v>Massimino's</v> are both excellent

<v>East Side Bar and Grill</v>. Cambridge St. East Cambridge. Great pizza

Not as exciting as the Burritos from <v>Anna's</v> last eve 

if you do end up in <v>East Cambridge</v>, head down to <v>Kendall Square</v> for <v>Lord Hobo</v>.

see you at <v>iggys</v> tomorrow

There's <v>Boston Beer Works</v> and <v>Cask n Flagon</v> right next to the park.

I second the <v>North End</v>. My favorite restaurant there is <v>La Summa</v> on Fleet Street---homemade sauce and pasta--delicious

If you'll be sailing on Shout this Wednesday, please give me your dinner order from the <v>Anna's</v> menu (http://www.annastaqueria.com/lunch_and_dinner.html) by 9 am on Wednesday.

Seafood with a view (on water): <v>Legal Harborside</v> -- first floor casual, 2nd floor fine dining, 3rd floor rooftop bar.

ate at a place called the <v>barking crab</v> and really enjoyed it

<v>Maggianos Little Italy</v> (i think i spelt that right...) Good italian food for a great price 

<v>Coppa</v> is a favorite of mine and it is open from lunch on every day but Saturday. 

<v>Durgin Park</v> is an icon. Their Indian Pudding is legendary.

<v>Kings</v> is in the <v>Back Bay</v> and has a sort of "clam shack" style restaurant next door- <v>Summer Shack</v>. 

<v>Craigie on Main</v> is much more expensive than the others, so keep that in mind.

I also love the Monkfish Marsala and Swordfish vinaigrette at the <v>Daily Catch</v> (northern ave and hanover street )

<v>Legal Sea foods</v> - I like the Long Wharf restaurant. 

My half-Neapolitan son raves about <v>Area Four</v> and has on occasion brought some home for his parents.

while the <v>Red House</v> is comfortable, cozy & really lovely food.

<v>Ten Tables</v> Cambridge, <v>Posto</v> or <v>Oishii Boston</v>. I mostly like those places. 

Maybe a suburban restaurants, like <v>Alta Strada</v>, <v>L'Andana</v> and <v>Blue Ginger</v>.

Plan is <v>Sabur</v> at 7! Meet at <v>Teele</v> at 630 for departure. Did we ever resolve the cake issue?

If <v>Kendall</v> area is okay, how about <v>State Park</v> or <v>Belly</v>?

Half Off at <v>Jose's Mexican Restaurant</v>. We should actually do this one!!!!

We had originally plan for November 12 at noon at <v>Stephi's</v>.

The <v>Salty Pig</v> is awesome!

also, the roof deck at the <v>Legal Seafood</v> has decent sushi and nice harbor views, good for lunch or dinner on a warm day. 

<v>Redbones</v>/ <v>underbones</v> could be a good choice! Although I get BBQ all the time in TX. Haha, really anywhere in <v>Davis</v> works for me.

<v>Chinatown</v> is my favorite place to eat in <v>Boston</v>: <v>Peach Farm</v>, <v>Gourmet Dumpling House</v>, <v>New Shanghai</v>, <v>Asian Garden</v>, <v>Best Little Restaurant</v>, <v>Great Taste restaurant</v>, <v>Xinh Xinh</v> and <v>Pho Pasteur</v> (both for Vietnamese and wonderful Pho), Shabu Shabu at <v>Q restaurant</v>, or <v>Kaze</v>.

I haven't heard anything about <v>Orleans</v>, but their menu looked good and I'd trust Dan's opinion. 

I'd suggest <v>Santarpio's</v>.

Could I just confirm with you the time you were thinking we could all meet for breakfast at <v>In a Pickle</v>?

I'm jealous that you guys still get to ski so often, but luckily ATO ski weekend is coming up soon and I'm working on getting a group together who would want to come up to <v>Sunday River</v> for a day.

Celebrate with fellow Obies from around the <v>Boston</v> area at <v>Scholars</v> American Bistro and Cocktail Lounge located in <v>Downtown Crossing</v>, along <v>Boston</v>'s historic <v>Freedom Trail</v>!

I also really enjoy the bars at <v>Nebo</v> http://neborestaurant.com/ & Trade http://trade-boston.com/

The suggestion of the <v>Hawthorne</v> is excellent, but not close to where you are staying.

<v>Durgin Park</v> is NOT famous for steak. It is famous for it's comical service (often rude) and old fashioned food.

It's a coastal storm, but they're expecting maybe as much as 2-4", (or maybe less, who knows?) of snow at <v>Sunday River</v>, mostly falling tomorrow. So it's possible, but not a sure thing, that you might have fun (probably not epic) ski conditions up there tomorrow afternoon. 

<v>Mike's City Diner</v> is a great place for breakfast :

Hey would you rather meet at the <v>old Chicago</v> in <v>broomfield</v>?

Thursday afternoon is good. I've got a meeting from 2-3pm. How about 3:30pm at <v>barrington coffee</v> roasters?

How about breakfast/coffee tomorrow at 7am at the <v>Nine Zero</v>?

If you want a steak house with a wow factor, try <v>Del Friscos</v>. It has great views of the harbor.

We are dining at the <v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> next Friday, April 18. 

gonna stop by <v>Formaggio</v> later.

<v>Eastern Standard</v> is a nice place for food & drinks. It's right on Kenmore Square and around the corner from the field.

There's a <v>McCormick and Schmick's</v> there that's good.

You could also try the <v>Barking Crab</v>, which has a full bar. 

I know of a little place called <v>starlite lounge</v> that serves some awesome cocktails.

Fri night @ <v>chilis</v> after tumbling?

Think <v>Doyle's cafe</v> opened in 1882 in <v>Jamaica Plain</v>.

We ate at a restaurant called "<v>Mare</v>" and <v>Neptune Oyster</v>...yum!!

I second <v>Modern Pastry</v>....I have always felt they are better hands down to <v>Mike's</v> or anyone else in the <v>North End</v>.

<v>Parish Cafe</v> on Boylston Street would be great for a nice day like today.

The Best team will receive Lunch @ <v>Mothers Bistro</v> (by the end of October)

<v>Summer Shack </v>may be a good option, since they are in a good and accessible location.

<v>Bay Point</v> Restaurant in <v>Quincy</v> is nice for a group

I recommend the <v>USS Constitution</v> in <v>Charlestown</v>, and the <v>Paul Revere House</v>. 

First round is on me at <v>pj ryans</v>! Meet at <v>teele</v> at 915 and we'll head out.

If you want Italian seafood, the <v>Daily Catch</v> on Hanover St. is great. 

Friday Dinner likely at <v>La Civetta</v> in <v>Falmouth</v> - http://www.osterialacivetta.com

At <v>Miracle of Science Bar & Grill</v>

or <v>Max Brenner</v> for chocolate desserts

If chocolate is your thing, try <v>Burdick's</v> on Brattle St, Harvard (only a 5 minute walk from Harvard Square T station.)

We could go to <v>nordstrom Rack</v>

Better make it Wednesday. 1pm at <v>Di Fara</v>?

Peking Duck at <v>Great China</v> in <v>Berkeley</v>

This week, I've chosen <v>Bison County</v> (on Moody St.) as our restaurant.  

Another place you could go would be <v>Bella Luna</v> in <v>Jamaica Plain</v>. It's a restaurant with a bowling alley downstairs.

The oldest Mexican restaurant in town is <v>Casa Romero</v>.  it's tucked in an alley in the <v>Back Bay</v> and is very cozy, even has a terrace.

Vice yoga 8 pm tomorrow which is Sunday at <v>gantcher</v>.

<v>Cambridge One</v> in <v>Harvard Square</v> and <v>Otto</v> in <v>Coolidge Corner</v> (<v>Brookline</v>) are both top notch.

<v>Brasserie Jo</v> is always our "go-to" for dinner before the symphony.

If you cut straight across to Massachusetts Avenue you might enjoy the Thai and Vietnamese food at <v>Pho Basil</v>

and <v>Cafe Rustica</v> is a nice little cafe in <v>Somerville</v>. 

Also in that area is <v>Grotto</v>, which is a bit higher-end Italian, but very tasty.

<v>In a pickle</v> is located really close to the Waltham stop of the commuter rail, so no need to see more Waltham than you'd like.

also ... Classic and historic: <v>Cantina Italiana</v>. Http://www.cantinaitaliana.com

I've not been to <v>Myers & Chang</v>, but it's been on my "to try" list for a while. Let us know how it is!

Róisín and I found a <v>GEM</v> near our place you'll have to check out

$5 for $10 Worth of Food and Drink (50% off) @ <v>Boloco</v>

The <v>Parker House</v> is also noted for the Parker House Roll. 

I also really like <v>La Summa</v> on Fleet St. 

My mom was the one interested in <v>Craigie on Main</v>. 

<v>Abe and Louie's</v> is fine, but very loud. <v>Oak Room</v> has better atmosphere as do <v>Capital Grille</v> and <v>Grill 23</v>, as well as <v>Mooo</v> and <v>KO Prime</v>.

How about <v>Daily Catch</v>?

I recommend <v>Tasty Burger</v>. 

7:30 <v>wynkoop</v> sounds good

Maybe at <v>Regal Beagle</v>?

<v>Banh Mi Ba Le</v> in <v>Dorchester</v> is even better, but is quite a hike.

meet you at <v>Bamboo</v>, around 5:00?

<v>Changsho</v> in <v>Cambridge</v> has a Sunday brunch buffet with supposedly all you can eat lobster. 

Cambridge/Somerville has <v>Club Passim</v>, <v>Johnny D's</v>, and the <v>Middle Eastern</v>.

<v>Island Creek Oyster Bar</v> has very good seafood but no view.

I'll probably stop for <v>Chipotle</v> before.

Any of the restaurants in the <v>South End</v> are close, but not really the most scenic of walks...
<v>Hammersley's Bistro</v>, <V>Aquaitaine</v>, <v>B & G Oysters</v>, <v>Franklin Cafe</v>, <v>647 Tremont</v>, <v>Grill 23</v>

Have you ever been to the <v>Peabody Essex Museum</v> in <v>Salem</v>? 

Cannot wait to experience 'game day' at <v>Fenway Park</v>.

Take a walk on the Harborwalk, visit <v>Castle Island</v> in <v>South Boston</v>, have a Hot Dog at <v>Sullivan's</v>. 

A great place to have a drink is the Rooftop Bar at <v>Legal Harborside</v>, but sometimes it can be hard to get into. 

I'd probably go to <v>Chipotle</v> at like 3:30, but we can meet there whenever.

and <v>Dali</v> is a very good standard Spanish tapas place in <v>Inman Square</v> in <v>Cambridge</v>

Which <v>chilis</v>?

For a steakhouse, I'd take them to <v>Grill 23</v>; for seafood, the second floor of <v>Legal Harborside</v> (great view) or <v>Oceanaire</v>.

I really like the <v>Yard House</v> before the game because they have a patio and if you go between 3-6, there half-off appetizer deal

the <v>Revere</v> is a sleek cool hotel which you may regret not choosing if you check it out.

You might consider trying <v>Bugaboo Creek</v>, which has a similar menu but a Canadian (as opposed to Australian) theme

For a steakhouse, I'd take them to <v>Grille 23</v>; for seafood, the second floor of <v>Legal Harborside</v> (great view) or <v>Oceanaire</v>.

I love <v>Kinsale</v> in <v>Government Center</v>! 

<v>Bristol Lounge</v> at the <v>Four Seasons</v>, <v>Bar at the Taj</v>, and <v>Oak Bar</v> at the Copley, are GREAT bars.

my favorite higher-end place is <v>Flemings</v>, which is at <v>Park Plaza</v> in <v>Boston</v>

and <v>Massimino's</v> on Endicott St.

Vicki votes for <v>Anna's</v>.

<v>Anna's Taqueria</v> orders for Wednesday:

I looked up <v>Antonio's</v> and it sounds delicious! 

A few early arrivals are getting together tonight at <v>PJ Ryan's</v> in <v>Teele Square</v>.

<v>Antonio's</v> is great and definitely walkable from Long Wharf. 

The Mapparium at the <v>Mary Baker Eddy Library</v> is kind of a weird but I think cool and unusual place to see.

<v>Kantin</v> has some very fine cantonese - i like their chow foon.

Theres always <v>chipotle</v> :)

Tufts Alumni Boston, a chapter of the Tufts University Alumni Association, invites you to join us at <v>Battery Park Bar & Lounge</v><http://www.batteryparkboston.com/>in <v>Boston</v>.

From your feedback I think I might narrow it down to <v>Coppa</v> and <v>Samar</v>.

Consider <v>La Voile</v>, Newbury St., <v>Brasserie Jo</v>, Huntington Ave., <v>Lala Rokh</v>, Mt. Vernon St. (Persian food).

<v>Durgin Park</v> used to be know for its Prime Rib (not steak). Haven't been there recently.

If you go into Cambridge at all you might want to try the <v>Friendly Toast</v> for breakfast.

<v>Legal Seafood</v> is a moderately priced local chain with reliably good quality seafood; 

While in <v>JP</v> you could also go to the <v>Sam Adams brewery</v> for a tour and some free beer.

Wanna rally the troops and go to <v>little India</v>?

If not, I can still do <v>Firebrand</v>.

Apparently at <v>TD garden</v>.

Magically, <v>Oleana</v> has availability for 2 at 7:30pm on Thursday. We could go there. I booked the reservation just in case :) 

Come celebrate a victorious summer at the CYC Awards Brunch, Sunday Nov 11, 11:30 am, at <v>Joe's American Bar and Grill</v>, 100 Atlantic Ave, <v>Boston</v>.

Kayla wants to try to go to <v>Little India</v> for dinner

Regardless of what you do, stop by <v>Mike's</v> for dessert :) The line is so worth it!

the <v>Revere</v> isn't far from the <v>South End</v>.

<v>Redbones</v>. Many taps, killer BBQ. 

The Mexican place (<v>Papagayo</v>) looks good.

Next is always <v>Wholy Grain</v> for a very good version of Jordan Marsh Blueberry Muffins.

Might be biased because my buddy lives a 5 minute walk away, but <v>Santarpio's</v> in <v>East Boston</v> for pizza

I really like <v>Beantown Taqueria</v>.

Maybe <v>Sonsie</v>? http://sonsieboston.com/flash/

the <v>Paramount</v> on Charles Street in <v>Beacon Hill</v> might fit the bill:

They closed 2 years ago but have relocated to another spot in <v>JP</v> closer to the <v>Sam Adams Brewery</v>

There is an optional BBQ at <v>Eastern Yacht Club </v> Friday night after the tent party. 

<v>Matt Murphy's</v> is a bit of an anomaly, a pub with excellent and inventive eats.

One good seafood restaurant, that is not often mentioned here, is <v>Oceanaire</v>.

let's do the <v>Starlite lounge</v> that sounds perfect and congratulations!

The <v>Beehive</v> has live music every night.

<v>Skywalk Observatory</v> at The <v>Prudential Center</v>/Tower - may consider lunch or drinks at <v>Top of the Hub</v> instead / as well.

Try <v>Jumbo Seafood</v> on Hudson St., or the <v>Grand Chau Chau</v> on Essex St.

The <v>Boston Sail Loft</v> 80 Atlantic Ave. on the waterfront on the edge of the <v>North End</v> near Christopher Columbus Park.

I've never been to either so am probably no help, but from their websites <v>Post 390</v> looks a lot fancier and more expensive. 

There are a lot of restaurants that would work. Also consider <v>Antico Forno</v>.

Breakfast in <v>Falmouth</v> from <v>Pickle Jar</v>

<v>Grafton Street pub</v> in <v>Harvard Square</v> Cambridge

ten pin bowling is available in the center of the city. <v>Kings</v> is in the <v>Back Bay</v>.

<v>Bartley's Burger Cottage</v> is so over-run with people, there is always a line to get in. 

For movies, if you want to see any while you're here, there's a big <v>Loews theater</v> across from the <v>Boston Common</v> that does all the major releases. 

I think the exterior of the "Harvard bar" in Good Will Hunting was the <v>Bow & Arrow</v> 

One of my favorite places for seafood isn't too far away from your hotel... The <v>Barking Crab</v>, on Sleeper St.

Ya i was surprised by <v>Eastern Standard</v> too. Their cocktails are good, but the food isn't great.

There's a <v>Legal Sea foods</v> in <v>Park Square</v> not far from you

I like the <v>Daily Catch</v> ... on Hanover Street in the <v>North End</v> and on Northern Ave.

I like both <v>Summer Shack</v> and <v>McCormicks</v>. Their happy hour is a great deal (food only). 

I also like <v>Posto</v> in <v>Somerville</v>.

Also across the street from <v>Blue Man group</v> is <v>California Pizza Kitchen</v>

Cambridge - I like <v>Area Four</v>

Any of the restaurants in the <v>South End</v> are close, but not really the most scenic of walks...
<v>Hamersley's Bistro</v>, <V>Aquaitaine</v>, <v>B & G Oysters</v>, <v>Franklin Cafe</v>, <v>647 Tremont</v>, <v>Grille 23</v>

Tuesday, Feb 11th 12pm at <v>JM Curley</v> it is.

Folks do enjoy the clam chowder although <v>Durgin Park</v> is not the place that came to mind to get it.

I've never been to <v>80 Thoreau</v>.

The <v>Salty Pig</v> is right next to your hotel and it is wonderful. You can get great wood fired pizzas, or you can make up your own platters of cured meats and cheese

We need a good dinner to prepare. Lets go to <v>Annas</v>.

I would go with The <v>Summer Shack</v>, 50 Dalton St. Excellent seafood, casual atmosphere. Outstanding choice of oysters. 

Possibly walk eastward along the Charles River, head inland on Massachusetts Avenue at the <v>MIT</v> campus, and get something to eat at the <v>Flour Bakery</v>.

<v>Gran Gusto</v> looks really good - I used to work next door at 86 Sherman Street but that was 10 years ago - it wasn't there back then!

We need a good dinner to prepare. Lets go to <v>Annas</v>. Meet at <v>Teele</v> at 730? I can drive.

So <v>Mr Bartley's</v> burger bar in <v>Harvard Square</v> at 9:00?

And so it the <v>Salty Pig</v> (their food is great, and so is their beer selection!)

<v>Al Dente</v> on Salem. Small, excellent Italian, friendly service. 

How about Tuesday Feb 11th at noon at <v>JM Curley</v>?

The <v>Museum of Fine Arts</v> in <v>Boston</v> is open until 9:45, Weds, Thurs, Friday 

If Central Square is an option, maybe <v>Brick and Mortar</v> or <v>Green Street Grill</v>?

And <v>Toro</v> is amazing...but no reservations. Awesome food, though!

In the other direction, The <v>Barking Crab</v> is a great place for seafood

I sent out an e-mail a few days ago, but this is just a reminder about the dinner we're having tomorrow night at <v>Watch City Brewing Co</v> in <v>Waltham</v>.

<v>Pj ryans</v>. Trivia night at 10, anyone interested?

Regarding <v>Amaluna</v>, I haven't been but there's some reviews on TA and on yelp that might be of use.

<v>Coppa</v> is one of my favorites and closer to your hotel.

Or if you're looking for a cheaper/simpler option we can do <v>S&S</v>, also in <v>Inman</v>

<v>Sycamore</v> in <v>Newton Center</v>

If it's a nice day, go to <v>Charlie's Kitchen</v>

How about the <v>Local</v> in <v>Wayland</v> or <v>Wellesley</v>?

<v>Ruth's Chris</v>  in the Old <v>Boston City Hall</v> are all very nice.

You can also use your tourist link pass for the Inner Habor Ferry to Charlestown to see the <v>USS Constitution</v>.

<v>Rabia's</v> in the <v>North End</v>. They actually have two separate and full menus. One Italian and one Seafood.

<v>Ricardo's</v> and <v>genaro's</v> 5 North Square might work. 

Very casual with good variety: <v>Ricardo's</v>: http://riccardosnorthend.com

Marge and I had floated the idea of going out and grabbing drinks in the <v>North End</v> somewhere. I can confirm that the <v>fiore</v> roof deck bar has a particularly fantastic sangria.

<v>Fiore</v> is pretty awesome... And the sangria comes in pitchers! 

We could go to <v>Silvertone</v>, its right near the park st T and would be convenient for people walking there and those on the red line. Its a neat place! 

Sure, 10 am? <v>Starbuck</v> on Tremont?

You may want to eat near the airport. <v>Donna's restaurant</v> in <v>East Boston</v> has exactly what you want and will be quiet early in the morning.

if you do end up in <v>East Cambridge</v>, head down to <v>Kendall Square</v> for <v>Meadhall</v>.

Lunch: The <v>Parish Cafe</v> 361 Boylston St. near the <v>Public Garden</v>. Funky, fun sandwiches.

my favorite pizza and pub grub is at <v>Woody's</v> another block beyond Mass Ave. 

I just found this awesome deal on LevelUp: $5 for $10 Worth of Food and Drink (50% off) @ <v>Boloco</v>

Then to <v>Formaggio</v> to pick up a cheese or two for supper. 

<v>Antonio's</v> -- Bingo! Thank you.

<v>Myers + Chang</v> has some of the best Asian dishes in the <v>South End</v>.

<v>Rino's</v> is in a class all by itself. The wait times are considerable, but the food is off the charts good. I'm going tomorrow - so excited!

<v>Toro</v> is one of the most highly regarded tapas restaurants in <v>Boston</v>. They serve a wonderful Sunday brunch, but it doesn't start until 10:30am.

We really like a Persian restaurant called <v>Lala Rokh</v>. It is located in the heart of <v>Boston</v> - <v>Beacon Hill</v> area.

Can you come to my neck of the woods, say <v>Sorelle</v> on Congress street?

<v>Fire and Ice</v> - amazing stir fry - you get your bowl and put in all the items you want

How about getting dinner at <v>Oleana</v> next Tuesday night at 7:30pm?

For the wow factor, I like <v>Sorellina</v>. Modern Italian, meat on the menu, and an attractive, spacious room.

When we go to the Theater we eat at <v>Troquet</v>

if you do end up in <v>East Cambridge</v>, head down to <v>Kendall Square</v> for <v>Cambridge Brewing Company</v>.

The idea was formed on Thursday to start a week by going for breakfast to the most amazing breakfast place in <v>Waltham</v> called <v>In a pickle</v>.

Ugh, <v>Zaftigs</v>!

Do you want to meet outside the <v>legal sea foods</v> in <v>Kendall</v> and find our way from there?

For good clam chowder, <v>Turner Fisheries</v> at the <v>Westin Copley hotel</v>, or <v>Legal Sea foods</v> (any location).

Not that I turn away from <v>Davis</v> since I don't live in Somerville: <v>Redbones</v>, <v>Boston Burger</v>, <v>Posto</v>,

We added a week of practice thanks to the ability to get warm and see video.  Yes, the video era at Tufts Sailing has begun.  We had three short team racing practices with video de-briefs this week to begin thinking about what we need to do to be the best at team racing.  We had a rather ignominious end finishing last at AC's after almost winning the Schell trophy.  There is a new spring schedule with team race NE's moving to early April followed by a three week fleet racing season.  We plan to get as far ahead of the other teams as we can, when we can, so look for us to hit the water again in February.  In the meantime our next event is our end-of-season awards dinner/slide show with Capture the Flag in the Fells and lasagna at ATO December 6.
