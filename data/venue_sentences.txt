Thinking about checking out the <v>Boston Public Library</v> (both hubby and I would like to see it, but obviously not much for the kids there so if it's really out of the way or a hassle to drop in, could give it a miss)

Also the <v>Freedom Trail</v> (have read about it, again, might be tricky with the kiddos?)

Other things on our "Would like to do" list include: The <v>Children's Museum</v>

were playing badminton in front of <v>ato</v> til it gets dark/8 and theres 2  of us with 4 rackets so come and challenge us

By the way, I was able to park the Explorer at <v>ATO</v> for the week, so I'm all set to keep it until Friday when I come home.

IF YOU EVER PARK YOUR CAR AT <v>ATO</v> READ THIS

We added a week of practice thanks to the ability to get warm and see video.  Yes, the video era at Tufts Sailing has begun.  We had three short team racing practices with video de-briefs this week to begin thinking about what we need to do to be the best at team racing.  We had a rather ignominious end finishing last at AC's after almost winning the Schell trophy.  There is a new spring schedule with team race NE's moving to early April followed by a three week fleet racing season.  We plan to get as far ahead of the other teams as we can, when we can, so look for us to hit the water again in February.  In the meantime our next event is our end-of-season awards dinner/slide show with Capture the Flag in the Fells and lasagna at <v>ATO</v> December 6.

Lots of shopping in <v>Back Bay</v>: <v>Prudential Center</v> mall, <v>Downtown Crossing</v>, <v>Quincy Market</v> area (a bit more touristy).

Think we're gonna take the T to <v>Harvard Square</v> and walk around

<v>Charlie's</v> in <v>Harvard Square</v> has a great outdoor beer garden tucked away in back.

Boston Cream Pie at <v>Parker House</v> to go?

The <v>Last Hurrah</v> does serve food and there is no requirement that you consume alcohol there so you do not have to indulge or drink water. 

If you do it on a nice day you can go to the <v>Brewer Fountain</v> area on the <v>Boston Common</v>, grab a table, and enjoy it al fresco.

I just had a really, really good pie at The <v>Black Rose Pub</v> on State Street. 

Wednesday 6th- <v>Plymouth Plantation</v>, <v>Plymouth Rock</v>, the <v>mayflower</v>

drive to <v>Hyannis</v> for late lunch and see the town

drive to <v>Provincetown</v> dinner (Hotel as close to <v>Provincetown</v> as possible)

I think your plan is do-able, the price at the <v>Woburn hotel</v> is well worth it. 

Geeze, I am sorry, I meant <v>Woburn hotel</v>, not Waltham.

I'm going to look into <v>Eventide Motel</v> in <v>Wellfleet</v>. 

I think it's the <v>Embassy Suites</v> next to <v>Costco</v> in <v>Waltham</v>. 

Stay In <v>North Truro</v> near <v>Provincetown</v>.

I would budget more time for <v>Plymouth</v> and probably eat lunch there.

There's also the <v>Prudential Center</v> and <v>Copley</v> which are malls of sorts. 

For cheaper stuff, check out <v>Marshalls</v> on Boylston St. 

You can get to <v>Assembly Row</v> in <v>Somerville</v> via public transport without waiting for the subway station to be built. 

Take the Orange line to <v>Sullivan Square</v> and then the #95 bus from there. 

<v>Neptune Oyster</v> in the <v>North End</v> is the place to go for that. 

In <v>Boston</v> try <v>Neptune Oyster</v>.

On the Cape try <v>Sesuit Cafe</v> in <v>Dennis</v>.

Check out a <v>99 restaurant</v>

The only <v>99</v> near <v>downtown Boston</v> is in <v>Charlestown</v>.

Weds AM - try to hit <v>Revere beach</v>? 

Tues AM - start with <v>Duck Tour</v>.

Day 8 - head towards <v>Burlington</v>, stop at <v>Ben & Jerry's</v> factory.

Great. Yes, we are staying near <v>Beacon</v>/<v>Harvard</v> so I'll keep <v>Pizzeria Regina</v> on the list 

Can explore more - <v>Freedom Trail</v>? 

Stay in <v>Coolidge Corner</v>?

Game at <v>Fenway</v> after lunch, dinner in <v>Brookline</v>.

Should we make a trip to the <v>Pru</v> / <v>Skywalk</v>?

Tuesday - <v>Duck Tour</v> in AM, check out <v>Museum of Science</v>, Lunch, walk around <v>Boston Commons</v> etc. 

Any overnight parking close to <v>Copley Square</v>?

I don't find Boston parking to be too tough, except in parts of <v>Cambridge</v> & the <v>South End</v>. Good luck!

Why not stay in <v>Concord</v>?

Agreed, look at the <v>Colonial Inn</v>.

It is in the center of <v>Concord</v>.

Also, the <v>Aloft</v> and the <v>Element</v> in <v>Lexington</v>, right off 95.

They're both a short drive from either downtown <v>Lexington</v> or downtown <v>Concord</v>.

Lots of people live in <v>Concord</v> and drive to the <v>Alewife</v> T station.

The <v>Westin</v> is right on the edge of the <v>South End</v>.

An old standby in the <v>South End</v> is <v>Hamersley's Bistro</v>.

<v>Myers + Chang</v> has some of the best Asian dishes in the <v>South End</v>.

<v>Toro</v> has wonderful Tapas and other Spanish theme dishes.

My husband and I had a wonderful brunch on the patio at <v>Hamersley's</v> yesterday. 

<v>Mike's City Diner</v> is a great place for breakfast.

<v>PICCO</v> stands for Pizza and Ice Cream Company and their ice cream is also fantastic.
